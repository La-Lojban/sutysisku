Technically, $x_1$ (therefore, also $x_2$) and $x_3$ are mutually so, as well. However, $x_3$ will typically be used in order to identify the 'side of the family tree/genealogy' being considered and $x_2$ will typically be the focal point at which the several sides of family trees (including the considered one) intersect (being otherwise disjoint); as such, $x_2$'s paternal uncle will not be described as being $x_2$'s father's brother on $x_2$'s side of the tree. In other words, there is a large family tree with at least two 'sides' and they intersect at exactly one node; this node of intersection is canonically to typically be $x_2$ and $x_3$ is canonically to typically be used to designate which of these possible sides is being considered such that $x_1$ belongs to it. (Symmetry is enabled by the fact that the only inferrable family tree is the 'side' produced; the larger family tree is unknown, and so the collection of potential sides amongst which the specification is taken is also unknown). The largest family tree (graph union of all sides of the mentioned relatives) is the graph which the utterer and/or relatives mentioned consider to be the entirety of the family of all the relatives mentioned (plus some near relatives, so long as they belong to exactly one side); thus, it may include marriages, god-children, close friends, and exes, but it is unlikely to span over many generations. For example, maternal and paternal sides of families are considered to be separate sides of the family tree for a child, even if in the distant unknown past, that father and that mother share some sort of familial relationship (even including a biological common ancestor). This word can be used to hint at a path in the graph from $x_1$ to $x_2$, since there exists a path which connects them and which also includes $x_3$; therefore, it can be used to vaguely mean \"my onclic aunt-in-law by my Uncle John\" meaning that the referent is the utterer's Uncle John's wife's sister (or sister in law); use connectives in $x_3$ in order to include (if the connective means \"AND\") more nodes which must have paths (not necessarily the same ones) running through them from $x_1$ to $x_2$. This word does not actually specify any of the relations between $x_1$, $x_2$, or $x_3$ arguments; it merely claims that they are all related and belong to a common (effective) family tree. Use tanru or {lanzu} for greater detail.","maternal relative","paternal relative","side of a family tree","a|wl|wm|wn","a|wi","o|V|wi|wj|wk|Z|wo|wp","bansu'o'u","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''sou'' (Southern Thai).","a|wr","o|V|wr|ws|s|Z|Wr|wt","banburubu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''brb'' (Lave).","Lave","a|wx","a|wv","o|V|wv|ww|s|Z|wy|wz","bansu'otu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''sot'' (Southern Sotho).","Sotho","a|x3","a|x1","o|V|x1|x2|s|Z|x4|x5","bansu'osu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''sos'' (Seeku).","Seeku","a|x9","a|x7","o|V|x7|x8|s|Z|xA|xB","bansu'oru","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''sor'' (Somrai).","Somrai","a|xF","a|xD","o|V|xD|xE|s|Z|xG|xH","banburucu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''brc'' (Berbice Creole Dutch).","Creole Dutch","a|xL","a|xJ","o|V|xJ|xK|s|Z|xM|xN","bansu'opu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''sop'' (Songe).","Songe","a|xR","a|xP","o|V|xP|xQ|s|Z|xS|xT","bansu'o'o","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''soo'' (Songo).","Songo","a|xX","a|xV","o|V|xV|xW|s|Z|xY|xZ","bansu'omu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''som'' (Somali).","a|xb","o|V|xb|xc|s|Z|Wf|xd","bansu'olu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''sol'' (Solos).","Solos","a|xh","a|xf","o|V|xf|xg|s|Z|xi|xj","bansu'oku","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''sok'' (Sokoro).","Sokoro","a|xn","a|xl","o|V|xl|xm|s|Z|xo|xp","bansu'oke","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''soq'' (Kanasi).","Kanasi","a|xt","a|xr","o|V|xr|xs|s|Z|xu|xv","bansu'oju","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''soj'' (Soi).","Soi","a|xz","a|xx","o|V|xx|xy|s|Z|y0|y1","bansu'oje","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''soy'' (Miyobe).","Miyobe","a|y5","a|y3","o|V|y3|y4|s|Z|y6|y7","bansu'o'i","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''soi'' (Sonha).","Sonha","a|yB","a|y9","o|V|y9|yA|s|Z|yC|yD","bansu'ogu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''sog'' (Sogdian).","Sogdian","a|yH","a|yF","o|V|yF|yG|s|Z|yI|yJ","bansu'o'e","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''soe'' (Songomeno).","Songomeno","a|yN","a|yL","o|V|yL|yM|s|Z|yO|yP","bansu'odu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''sod'' (Songoora).","Songoora","a|yT","a|yR","o|V|yR|yS|s|Z|yU|yV","bansu'ocu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''soc'' (So (Democratic Republic of Congo)).","So (Democratic Republic of Congo)","a|yZ","a|yX","o|V|yX|yY|s|Z|ya|yb","bansu'obu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''sob'' (Sobei).","Sobei","a|yf","a|yd","o|V|yd|ye|s|Z|yg|yh","bansu'o'a","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''soa'' (Thai Song).","Thai Song","a|yl","a|yj","o|V|yj|yk|s|Z|ym|yn","bansunuzu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''snz'' (Sinsauru).","Sinsauru","a|yr","a|yp","o|V|yp|yq|s|Z|ys|yt","xadni'arno","$x_1$ is distal.","s|Describes body-parts/regions of the body.

The number of polytope 'tiles' used can be specified in the third of fifth terbri as desired; the polytopes used need not all be the same, nor regular, so long as the arrangement is meaningful and possible. One of the main differences between rectangular polyplets and polyominoes is that polyominoes cannot have their polytope tiles touching only at their vertices whereas polyplets can (thus, polyominoes are a subset of the rectangular polyplets); this difference can be specified in the final terbri. A tiling of a space may be considered to be an infinite polyform, but that is rather pathological and we can reasonably assume that polyforms referenced by this word will be finite. The polyform is considered to be a unified whole entity. The ambient space is usually going to be the Euclidean space of the same dimension as the polytopes (and the former dimension cannot be exceeded by the latter except in the marginal case of lower-dimensional (id est: hyperplanar) arrangements, in which case parallel cross-sections are really being considered); this space determines the rigid-motion/symmetry isomorphisms of various polyforms (Z and S tetraminoes are non-isomorphic under rigid-motion in the Euclidean plane but are so isomorphic in Euclidean 3-space). The ambient space also determines the expression of (and indeed the 'allowed') polytopes: spherical geometry allows for digons to be arranged so as to form a polyform, but Euclidean 2-space prohibits such objects from the set of possible polygons. The default polytope will probably be a 2-dimensional square; thus the default ambient space will likely be Euclidean 2-space.

Definition of which differintegral operator is being used is context-dependent if not specified explicitly by $x_5$. Dimensionality of $x_1$ and $x_2$ may be similarly specified. Output $x_1$ is a function, not a value (that is, it is some $f$ rather than $f(x)$); it must be specified/restricted to a value in order to be a value; thus, output may be $g'$ but not $g'(a)$ for some $a$; similarly, definite integrals and integration constants must be defined with additional effort. $x_2$ is likewise a function. If $x_2$ is univariate, then $x_3$ defaults to that input/variable; when $x_2$ is physical, without context, time will probably usually but not necessarily be assumed as the default of $x_3$ (but may be made explicit by \"{temci} {zei} salrixo\" or merely \"{temsalri}\"). Positive values of $x_4$ are integrals, negative values are derivatives, and zero is identity; at the least, any real value may be supplied for $x_4$; $x_4$ has no default value. Useful for making lujvo for physics, for specifying career/total/sum versus peak/instantaneous value, for distinguishing between instantaneous versus average values/quantities, for specifying rates, generalized densities (including pressure), \"per\" for smooth quantities, etc. See also: \"{salri}\" (synonymous gismu).","derivative","differintegral","integral","a|6y0|6y1|6y2","a|6xx","o|V|6xx|6xy|6xz|Z|6y3|6y4","banju'uru","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''jur'' (Jurúna).","Jurúna","a|6y8","a|6y6","o|V|6y6|6y7|s|Z|6y9|6yA","banju'upu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''jup'' (Hupdë).","Hupdë","a|6yE","a|6yC","o|V|6yC|6yD|s|Z|6yF|6yG","saltrcefi","$s_1$ (mass) is a quantity of Chef salad [food] with ingredients/components including $k_1=s_2$ (mostly fresh leafy vegetables).","Chef salad","a|6yK","a|6yI","o|1z|6yI|6yJ|Z|6yL|6yM","saltrkolslo","$s_1$ (mass) is a quantity of coleslaw salad [food] with ingredients/components including $s_2$.","coleslaw","a|6yQ","a|6yO","o|1z|6yO|6yP|Z|6yR|6yS","saltrpikodegalo","en$s_1$ (mass) is a quantity of pico de gallo/ensalada fresca/salada mexicana [food] with ingredients/components including $s_2$.","See also: mexican salad (={mexsalta}).","pico de gallo","a|6yX","a|6yU","o|V|6yU|6yV|6yW|Z|6yY|6yZ","saltrsesari","$s_1$ (mass) is a quantity of Caesar salad [food] with ingredients/components including $s_2$.","A salad attributed to restaurateur Caesar Cardini","Caesar salad","a|6ye","a|6yb","o|V|6yb|6yc|6yd|Z|6yf|6yg","saltrvaldorfo","$s_1$ (mass) is a quantity of Waldorf salad [food] with ingredients/components including $r_1=s_2$.","Waldorf salad","a|6yk","a|6yi","o|1z|6yi|6yj|Z|6yl|6ym","saltrvinegre","$s_1$ (mass) is a quantity of vinegret salad [Russian: Винегрет] with ingredients/components including $s_2$.","vinegret","a|6yq","a|6yo","o|1z|6yo|6yp|Z|6yr|6ys","banju'u'o","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''juo'' (Jiba).","Jiba","a|6yw","a|6yu","o|V|6yu|6yv|s|Z|6yx|6yy","banju'unu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''jun'' (Juang).","Juang","a|6z2","a|6z0","o|V|6z0|6z1|s|Z|6z3|6z4","banju'umu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''jum'' (Jumjum).","Jumjum","a|6z8","a|6z6","o|V|6z6|6z7|s|Z|6z9|6zA","banju'ulu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''jul'' (Jirel).","Jirel","a|6zE","a|6zC","o|V|6zC|6zD|s|Z|6zF|6zG","banju'uku","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''juk'' (Wapan).","Wapan","a|6zK","a|6zI","o|V|6zI|6zJ|s|Z|6zL|6zM","banju'uje","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''juy'' (Juray).","Juray","a|6zQ","a|6zO","o|V|6zO|6zP|s|Z|6zR|6zS","banju'udu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''jud'' (Worodougou).","Worodougou","a|6zW","a|6zU","o|V|6zU|6zV|s|Z|6zX|6zY","banju'ucu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''juc'' (Jurchen).","a|6za","o|V|6za|6zb|s|Z|V7|6zc","banju'ubu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''jub'' (Wannu).","Wannu","a|6zg","a|6ze","o|V|6ze|6zf|s|Z|6zh|6zi","banju'u'a","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''jua'' (Júma).","Júma","a|6zm","a|6zk","o|V|6zk|6zl|s|Z|6zn|6zo","banjusulu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''jsl'' (Japanese Sign Language).","Japanese Sign Language","a|6zs","a|6zq","o|V|6zq|6zr|s|Z|6zt|6zu","banjuru'u","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''jru'' (Japrería).","Japrería","a|6zy","a|6zw","o|V|6zw|6zx|s|Z|6zz|700","tulnrstanu","s|$x_1$ reflects the geography/culture/history of the region constituting central Eurasia, including/especially former Eurasian territory of the Persian Empire, the Eurasian steppes, and regions near the Black and Caspian Seas (such as the modern regions/countries ending in \"-stan\" (and several others)), in property/aspect $x_2$","s|This takes into account modern-day developments (unlike, possibly, other names meaning \"Persian\").
