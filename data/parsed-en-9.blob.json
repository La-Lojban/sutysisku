Iff the seed value is 1, the mode is set thereinafter to multiplicative style; iff the seed value is 0, the mode is set thereinafter to additive style. (That is: the seed values represent the identity elements under the operation which the mode emulates.).  No other value, numerical or otherwise (including other sumti or even Boolean values, which actually mean \"truth\" and \"false\", rather than \"1\" and \"0\" respectively, despite common representations), may act as a seed value of this word.  Thus, only in the context of this word being followed by a \"li\"-introduced mekso expression X which evaluates to the numbers 0 or 1 wherein X is not intended to be taken as a seed value of this word must this word be followed by {ku} prior to X; in this case there is no explicit seed value. If this word has no explicit seed value, then this word causes the mode of interpretation of double-negatives to switch between multiplicative style and additive style; an utterance of this word switches the mode to whichever of these two options was not being used immediately previously.  Thus, it is its own terminator/negator.  Lojban default (without context) is in multiplicative mode: \"mi na na nelci\" is nearly equivalent to \"mi nelci\"; double-negatives cancel leaving a positive sense (even if it is not entirely/definitively affirmative). So, one utterance of this word (under standard conventions) in a given discourse will change double-negatives to become additive. This mode is similar to (some) Spanish negation or AAVE negation; multiple negatives compound/add together, intensifying the negativity (subjective truth-value) of an utterance.  In additive mode, \"[zau'e'u] mi na na nelci\" is equivalent to \"mi ba'e na nelci\" or something of the like; \"[zau'e'u] mi na na na na nelci\" would be simply further emphasized (roughly twice as emphatic as the previous example's negation).

This happens on structure c, which defines what various values and limits mean. b is the 'order' of the result of this convergence (so that it is the bth-order integral (equivalently, -bth-order derivative) of the Heaviside step/Theta function with respect to a so that b = -1 yields the Dirac delta 'function' centered/with interesting point at 0, b = 0 yields the Heaviside step/Theta function with respect to a centered at/with interesting point 0, etc.).  Natural numbers (or 0) for b yield a 'special' polynomial (let us call it p) of that order in indeterminant a for all values of a greater than 0 and 0 for all values of a less than 0 so that p(a) = a^b Theta(a). Input e is for when the particular functions in d are of interest and only e of them have been computed (so that, for finite e, the output is not exactly the bth order Heaviside function); in other words, the limit of the family indices is being taken to e; this is of particular importance for negative values of b: |b| > 1, since they will not be identically 0 in some sense (else, all information is lost about the special structure/nature of this function). The contextless defaults are: b = 0, c is the field of real numbers (with absolute value norm and ordering due to signed absolute value), d is bth-order integral of ((1 + y + z * erf(k a / (2^(1/2)) ) ) / 2)-like functions that are properly normalized and are of proper height, e is infinity (countable). Heaviside(0,0,...,f_0) = 1/2 = f_0 is typical and is a contextless default for b = 0 (however, it may in particular be set to 0 or 1 so that the function is left-/right-continuous at a = 0; for values of b other than 0, f_b = 0 is the contextless default; note that f_(-1) must be infinity 'of the proper magnitude' (it cannot be specified to be otherwise).

Given the other sumti in the predicate (filling the corresponding terbri), the underlying relation (selbri) is claimed to be invalid in this circumstance. Examples: \"non-integrable\", \"non-measurable\" (confer: \".{umre}\"), \"non-summable\" (say, of strings), \"the limit does not exist\". This avoids the necessity of creating a pair of words for every such mathematical concept (one for when the operation may be applied to the inputs so as to yield a well-defined value which may be specified and one for when such is not the case). Other uses may develop or be found. This word does not 'delete' the terbri (unlike \"{zi'o}\"); it simply says that the selbri is not really applicable. Whether or not the meaning of this word is within the generic semantic range of \"{zo'e}\" is debatable and not yet well-established. The conventions employed matter. The case of the product of zero and infinity usually must be handled by a separate definition (especially when dealing only with strictly real numbers); it is quite common to explicitly handle this case by defining the product as zero, but prior to such definition, \"lo pilji be li no bei li ci'i\" is meaningless and undefined (the symbols can be written but do not actually mean anything) - so, $pilji_1$ should be filled with this word in such a circumstance. As another example, unless the difference of infinity with infinity is defined (and following the convention that unconnected points have a graph distance of positive countable infinity), which is unnatural, the relationship represented by \"{tseingu}\" is undefined in its fourth terbri (so, it can be filled with this word) when its first and second sumti belong to mutually different trees (leaving their most recent mutually common ancestor undefined). Notice that the other terbri are well-defined in this circumstance - in particular, $tseingu_3$ is positive countable infinity; also notice that this word has a slightly less mathematical flavor (especially insofar as the first terbri is not result of applying a mathematical operation to the following terbri) than many other ready examples. Yet another example: In a zero-dimensional universe, $klama_4$ and possibly $klama_5$, as well as even more arguably $klama_2$, are undefined (and can be filled with this word), leaving the notion of 'going' empty and meaningless.

The output is a string of digits, not a number; thus, it automatically attaches to a string of PA's if immediately preceding this word; following digits must be concatenated on; it might be necessary to convert this string into a number (especially if it is isolated and/or is being acted upon an operator that is defined as desired for numbers but not for digits or strings), but the conversion may be automatic according to the grammar (at least in some contexts). {xo'e} is considered to represent exactly one 'digit' (really: PA member) in the given base until it is converted into a number. Since {pi} belongs to PA, technically at least zero {xo'e}'s can actually be meant to be radix point(s); at most, the total allowable number of radix points in a digit string, less the number of explicitly mentioned {pi}'s that occur therein (within the macrodigit), is the number of {pi}'s that can be referenced elliptically by this means. {ma'u} and {ni'u} are possible references for microdigits where allowed by the base.  This word 'knows where it lives', meaning that it will only produce digit strings that are composed of PA's that are allowed by the base and notation given the rest of the context, which form allowed macrodigits, and which will represent part of a context-allowed number.

An answer is a SE string that is allowed by the selbri and by the subscripts; continuing the example, if the response is 'Ralph went to C from B', one would respond with '.i {setese}'.  Any SE word works for the general question possibility (which is the unrestricted/non-subscripted case). Essentially 'se'u'o xi sy' is equivalent to 'se xi li xo poi ke'a cmima sy' (where '{te}' is basically understood as ' se xi li jo'i pa boi ci te'u ', etc.), but the answer can be a complicated ordered sequence/string of SE words; this word complements specifically {fi'a} in the typical/same way that SE complements FA. Typically, leaving the subscripted set vague or not completely free of every possible semantic or syntactic pathology is perfectly fine; syntax and practicality will typically restrict it enough for reasonable responses to be made.

For example in English: \"I ain't seen nothin'\" means that the speaker is very emphatically claiming to have seen nothing of interest. This is the standard operation for negation in Spanish. \"Multiplicative negation\" means that negatives cancel, but do not intensify, one another (possibly taking a neutral or abstentional state). \"I did not see nothing\" in this mode means that the speaker did indeed see something. Note that multiplicative double-negatives are not necessarily equivalent to affirmatives in general. \"I like cheese\" is an affirmative statement and is not equivalent to \"I do not dislike cheese\", which is a multiplicative double-negative (and which may indicate a reluctant acceptance of cheese or a neutral feeling toward cheese). In this mode, an even number of negatives in a given statement is not negative and an odd number of negatives in a given statement is not positive. This word applies to all negatives in the text, whether they are free words or rafsi. This word also, but less dramatically, applies to affirmations: in additive mode, multiple affirmatives intensify one another (\"I am indeed very much so going!\" is a strongly emphasized positive statement); in multiplicative mode, they simply reduce to a single affirmation (for like example, \"I am going\"). This means that care must be taken: In additive mode, an affirmative marker will partially cancel with a negative particle in some way, reducing its intensity and possibly bringing it to a neutral statement (\"I am indeed - not - going\" is a neutral statement in this mode, similar to \"I may be going\"; English does not really have the ability to express such things); in multiplicative mode, an affirmative coupled with a negative simply reduces to the negative, possibly strengthened by a factor equivalent to the intensity of the affirmer (\"I am indeed not going\" is a clear way of saying that the speaker will not go).","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"NEIhAI","g":"double-negative mode toggle","cache":["nei'ai","double-negative","toggle:","every","odd-counted","explicit","usage","makes","negation","additive","unmentioned","or","even-counted","multiplicative.","it","applies","to","the","entirety","of","current","bridi","and","all","future","ones","until","toggled","again","multiple","but","separated","usages","this","word","within","same","behave","as","if","they","were","adjacent.","\"additive","negation\"","means","that","negatives","just","intensify,","do","not","cancel,","one","another.","for","example","in","english:","\"i","ain't","seen","nothin'\"","speaker","is","very","emphatically","claiming","have","nothing","interest.","standard","operation","spanish.","\"multiplicative","another","(possibly","taking","a","neutral","abstentional","state).","did","see","nothing\"","mode","indeed","something.","note","multiplicative","double-negatives","are","necessarily","equivalent","affirmatives","general.","like","cheese\"","an","affirmative","statement","dislike","cheese\",","which","(and","may","indicate","reluctant","acceptance","cheese","feeling","toward","cheese).","mode,","even","number","given","negative","odd","positive.","text,","whether","free","words","rafsi.","also,","less","dramatically,","affirmations:","intensify","(\"i","am","much","so","going!\"","strongly","emphasized","positive","statement)","simply","reduce","single","affirmation","(for","example,","going\").","care","must","be","taken:","marker","will","partially","cancel","with","particle","some","way,","reducing","its","intensity","possibly","bringing","-","going\"","similar","english","does","really","ability","express","such","things)","coupled","reduces","negative,","strengthened","by","factor","affirmer","clear","way","saying","go).","experimental","cmavo","neihai","toggle","t'e","t'is","wit'in","be'ave","t'ey","t'at","anot'er.","englis':","not'in'\"","emp'atically","'ave","not'ing","spanis'.","anot'er","not'ing\"","somet'ing.","c'eese\"","c'eese\",","w'ic'","c'eese","c'eese).","w'et'er","muc'","emp'asized","wit'","englis'","suc'","t'ings)","strengt'ened","double","counted","adjacent","i","nothin'","interest","spanish","state","something","general","text","rafsi","also","dramatically","affirmations","going","taken","things","go","not'in'","spanis'","somet'ing","t'ings"]},{"w":"ne'au","bangu":"en","d":"attitudinal: devoidness of emotion (neutral by absence of emotion) - overwhelmed by/replete with/overflowing with (seemingly all) emotion","n":"Carries no positive or negative connotations.

The immediately following (next) unfilled terbri at that level of nesting is affected by this word; if no such terbri exists at that level of nesting, this word's affects apply to the next unfilled terbri in the immediately higher level of nesting (unnested once); if no unfilled terbri exist at any/all levels of nesting and following the immediately previous sumti (even if unfilled terbri exist prior to that sumti), this word has no meaningful affect and can be ignored.  This word must be followed by a sumti; for the purpose of this explanation, this sumti will be xy (as in \"de'ai xy\").  The affected terbri is defined to default to the value xy (the sumti as a whole, including gadri, tanru, relative clauses, etc.); in other words, when not explicitly filled or when filled be {di'au}, the sumti value filling the affected terbri is that of xy.  This affect remains in effect until the end of the text/conversation or until/unless the default setting of this terbri explicitly redefined (overriding by {di'ei} is temporary/only applies to that usage). If xy is {zo'e}, the default value is completely general and elliptical; thus, permanently overriding a default setting on a specific terbri may be done by \"de'ai zo'e\". The scope of this word fully encompasses and ends with the following sumti (xy); thus, the second sumti, same-/higher-level terminator, a FA cmavo, etc. following this word ends the new default specification in addition to its other functions.  Additionally, this word does not actually fill the affected terbri with any particular sumti/value; it merely defines its default value hereinafter. CAUTION: Thus, the second same-level sumti uttered actually fills the affected terbri; in order to access the newly-defined default value of the terbri immediately after definition, follow \"xy\" (with terminator) immediately with implicit (or possibly explicit) \"{zo'e}\" (possibly necessitating terminators), \"{di'au}\", or \"xy\" itself. Moreover, therefore, the default value defined by this word does not immediately/necessarily affect the truth value of the statement in which it appears (it only does so if the second following sumti is not {di'au}, implicit (or possibly) explicit {zo'e}, or xy itself); however, in all future uses of the brivla to which the terbri belongs, unless explicitly filled with a sumti of a different value, the truth value of those statements will be affected.

If $m$ is defined, then its contextless default value is $m = 0$. This function/word first determines the base being used for interpretation of digit strings (determined by context or by explicit specification (JUhAU)) for/as applied to $x$; this determination takes place even before inputs are accepted after $x$; let this base be represented by $b$ throughout this description unless $b$ is explicitly specified as an input. In such case, if the base of $x$ is a positional system wherein each digit represents a corresponding multiple of a fixed natural number raised to the power of its position (as determined relative to the radix point) and wherein the overall number is the sum of these results/representands, or if $b$ is explicitly specified as an input, then $t$ is defined; if the base of $x$ is sufficiently bad or unclear and $b$ is not explicitly specified as an input, then $t$ is undefined. Of course, if $b$ is explicitly specified as an input, then that value (if valid) is the meaning of \"$b$\" throughout this description. If $t$ is undefined, then its slot is automatically and implicitly deleted from this word in that context (so the operator is at-most-3-ary and its input acceptance is terminated by the '$n$' xor '$m$' slot, whichever one is later yet defined (because, assumptively, '$b$' is not explicitly specified); if '$m$' is defined and explicitly uttered when '$t$' is undefined and the '$x$' and '$n$' values have been explicitly specified, then the third input is '$m$') and \"$b^t$\" $=$ \"$b^{(-t)}$\" $= b = 1$ formally for the purposes of this definition (but not necessarily for the base for any digit-to-number interpretation/conversion, particularly on $x$!). If $t$ is defined, then its contextless default value is $t = 0$. The rounding function, determined by $n$, is performed on $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$. If $n = 1$, then the rounding function is the ceiling function: $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the least integer that is greater than or equal to it; in other words, it rounds up. If $n = -1$, then the rounding function is the floor function: $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the greatest integer that is less than or equal to it; in other words, it rounds down. These integers are both determined by the ordering and metric. If $n = 0$, then the rounding function maps $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ to the integer that minimizes the metric distance between itself and $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ if a unique such integer exists (id est: $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the nearest integer, where \"nearest\"-ness is determined according to the order and metric); if no such unique integer exists, then $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the unique integer among these aforementioned options for which there exists an integer $Z$ such that $2Z+m$ is the integer in question; if no unique such integer exists, then the function is undefined. Thus, $n = 0$ produces the commonly used unbiased nearest-integer rounding function. In each of these cases, the output of the rounding function is then multiplied by sgn$(x) b^{t}$. Thus, it rounds at the $t$th digit if $b$ matches the base of $x$ and else to the nearest multiple of $b$ in the $t$th digit of abs$(x)$, so to speak. Notice that rounding up or down always is applied to the absolute value, so it is really rounding (positive or negative) infinity-ward or zeroward respectively. The order on, and the operators and metric endowing, the metric space and field of all real numbers is determined by context or by explicit specification. The absolute value function is denoted as \"abs( )\" in the definition, and the signum function sgn is such that sgn$(z) = z/$abs$(z)$ for all real $z:$ abs$(z) > 0$, and sgn$(0) = 0$.","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"VUhU","g":"ceiling function;floor function;nearest integer function;round down;rounding function;round to nearest integer;round up","cache":["ji'i'u","mekso,","at-most-5-ary","operator:","a","rounding","function","ordered","input","list","is","$(x,n,t,m,b)$","and","the","output","sgn$(x)$","$b^{t}$","round$_{n}$","$(b^{(-t)}$","abs$(x))$,","with","preference","$n$","where","fractional","part","of","$b^{(-t)}$","abs$(x)$","being","equal","to","$1/2$","causes","round$_{n}","($","$)$","map","nearest","integer","form","$2z+m$,","for","base","$b$","(determined","by","context","if","not","explicitly","input)","some","$z$","context).","this","rounds","$x$","toward","or","away","from","$0$","you","want","complementary","which","positive","negative","infinity,","then","see","\"{ji'i'u'u}\".","must","be","real","number","&","exactly","one","following:","$-1$,","$0$,","$1$","$t$","an","(contextless","default:","$0$)","defined","at","all","(see","infra)","$m$","xor","it","numerical","(if","determined","context)","nonzero","specified),","infra","(typically:","rational)","number.","does","have","contextless","default","value","determines","type","used","here","infra).","iff","$n","=","0$","is/would","undefined,","its","slot","automatically","implicitly","deleted","word","in","that","(so","operator","at-most-4-ary","final","argument","would","fill","'$t$'","'$b$'","under","condition","three","four","(resp.)","arguments","are","used).","defined,","$m","0$.","function/word","first","interpretation","digit","strings","explicit","specification","(juhau))","for/as","applied","determination","takes","place","even","before","inputs","accepted","after","let","represented","throughout","description","unless","specified","as","input.","such","case,","positional","system","wherein","each","represents","corresponding","multiple","fixed","natural","raised","power","position","(as","relative","radix","point)","overall","sum","these","results/representands,","input,","sufficiently","bad","unclear","undefined.","course,","valid)","meaning","\"$b$\"","description.","at-most-3-ary","acceptance","terminated","'$n$'","'$m$'","slot,","whichever","later","yet","(because,","assumptively,","specified)","uttered","when","undefined","'$x$'","values","been","specified,","third","'$m$')","\"$b^t$\"","$=$","\"$b^{(-t)}$\"","$=","b","1$","formally","purposes","definition","(but","necessarily","any","digit-to-number","interpretation/conversion,","particularly","on","$x$!).","$t","function,","$n$,","performed","$(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$.","1$,","ceiling","function:","$(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$","mapped","least","greater","than","other","words,","up.","-1$,","floor","greatest","less","down.","integers","both","ordering","metric.","0$,","maps","minimizes","metric","distance","between","itself","unique","exists","(id","est:","integer,","\"nearest\"-ness","according","order","metric)","no","exists,","among","aforementioned","options","there","$2z+m$","question","thus,","produces","commonly","unbiased","nearest-integer","function.","cases,","multiplied","sgn$(x)","b^{t}$.","$t$th","matches","else","abs$(x)$,","so","speak.","notice","up","down","always","absolute","value,","really","(positive","negative)","infinity-ward","zeroward","respectively.","on,","operators","endowing,","space","field","numbers","specification.","denoted","\"abs(",")\"","definition,","signum","sgn","sgn$(z)","z/$abs$(z)$","$z:$","abs$(z)",">","sgn$(0)","experimental","cmavo","vuhu","round","t'e","wit'","w'ere","t'is","w'ic'","t'en","'ave","'ere","t'at","t'ree","(ju'au))","t'roug'out","suc'","w'erein","eac'","t'ese","w'ic'ever","w'en","t'ird","t'an","ot'er","bot'","t'ere","t'us,","$t$t'","matc'es","vu'u","mekso","most","5","ary","x","n","t","m","_","abs","1","2","2z","z","0","infinity","ji'i'u'u","following","typically","rational","4","'","resp","juhau","case","point","results","representands","course","valid","3","because","assumptively","but","conversion","words","id","est","ness","thus","cases","th","speak","ward","respectively","endowing","ju'au","t'us","t'"]},{"w":"dei'a","bangu":"en","d":"tense interval modifier: decreasingly...; decrementative.

The construct as a whole syntactically functions as a parenthetical so that mekso may be resumed immediately thereafter without any difficulty. This word attaches to/affects the immediately preceding macrodigit string extending from the last evaluated number, number operation, etc. or bracket to/until this word. The preceding number is semantically interpreted according to the description to which the following sumti refers. If a sequence is supplied as the following sumti, the preceding number is interpreted so that each digit, starting from the left (default: see next), is understood as a multiple of the corresponding value in the sequence under the ordering given (which may produce an invalid/ill-formed result; the placement of {pi} matters as well).  If a single number is submitted (such as \"li {dau}\"), this word acts as {ju'u}; the number is interpreted according to the rules of mekso and is its own island for such interpretation (thus {ju'u} is needed to override a cultural/grammatical default interpretation, such as decimal, even if this is done within the mekso expression outside of and including the scope of this word). In this way, the sumti being (10^n)_n, which is a sequence, is the same as the sumti being just 10, but is very different from it being the sequence (10)_n.  The original default for numeral-position/string reading/interpretation is from left-to-right, where a digit on the left in a pair of digits represents that multiple of a \"later\" term in the sequence as compared to right member of the pair; thus \"23\" in decimal means (2*(10^1)) + (3*(10^0)), which is twenty-three.  This default may be overridden via specification of the sequence (either its ordering, its domain being negated, or alteration to the base); alternatively, and perhaps more easily, the appearance of \"la'e zoi jbo. ri'u bi'o zu'a .jbo\" will always reverse it (this is a special input value with interpretation defined by this grammar); when reversed, \"23\" in decimal means (2*(10^0)) + (3*(10^1)), which is to say thirty-two.  Generally, this word overrides the default interpretation of a string of microdigits when computing the value of a macrodigit (see: {ju'u'i}).

By default, the macrodigit is interpreted as being written/expressed in some cultural or grammatical default (this default is overridden by {ju'au} if its specifying sumti requires an alternative interpretation for the value of the macrodigits), probably decimal- the interpretation of the string of microdigits produces a number, x; the \"{pi'e}\" implies the denominator to be used in determining the fraction for which x is in the numerator and context or possibly a specified base determines its value- in timekeeping, the interpretation is typically x/60 for certain macrodigits. However, the default for determining the value of x given a string of microdigits might be useful to override (for example, Tsohnai uses an overall factorial base but each macrodigit is written in balanced quinary); this word specifies the base used for interpreting the macrodigit from a string of microdigits. It is placed at the end of the string (possibly before the next \"{pi'e}\") and its scope of effect extends from there, through the string of microdigits, to either the beginning of the number as a whole or the most recent \"{pi'e}\" (whichsoever was more recently uttered). It is to be followed by a sumti (or multiple sumti strung together by connectives) and has its scope of specification terminate with that sumti; in this regard, it works syntactically and semantically exactly like {ju'au}. In fact, {ju'au} can be used outside of the number in order to specify the macrodigit interpretation instead of this word (for example, if its sumti were la .tsonais., this word would not be needed); however, if only a sequence were to have been given as the argument of {ju'au} (such as the factorial sequence) and if some base other than decimal were desired for the interpretation of each macrodigit from the string of microdigits, then this word would be used. If only one macrodigit appears in the number, then this word is equivalent to {ju'au}. In short, the scope of this word is one contiguous string of microdigits, and it influences their interpretation into a macrodigit value in the same way that {ju'au} does. However, if both {ju'au} and this word specify how to interpret a given string of microdigits in the same number (composed of macrodigits), this word overrides the interpretation specified by {ju'au} (but only for this macrodigit); thus, for example, a Tsohnai number can have each of its macrodigits be interpreted in balanced quinary except one, which the speaker specifies via this word, because they know the value but did not want to convert it to balanced quinary (because it may be too large or hard to do so easily), so they instead expressed it in decimal.","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"JUhUhI","g":"long-digit interpretation specifier;macrodigit named base specifier","cache":["ju'u'i","long-digit","interpretation","specifier","macrodigit","named","base","when","a","string","of","multiple","digits","is","on","either","side","{pi'e},","the","to","be","interpreted","as","single","\"macrodigit\"","in","longer","numeric","let","that","compose","it","called","\"microdigits\"","for","clarity.","by","default,","being","written/expressed","some","cultural","or","grammatical","default","(this","overridden","{ju'au}","if","its","specifying","sumti","requires","an","alternative","value","macrodigits),","probably","decimal-","microdigits","produces","number,","x","\"{pi'e}\"","implies","denominator","used","determining","fraction","which","numerator","and","context","possibly","specified","determines","value-","timekeeping,","typically","x/60","certain","macrodigits.","however,","given","might","useful","override","(for","example,","tsohnai","uses","overall","factorial","but","each","written","balanced","quinary)","this","word","specifies","interpreting","from","microdigits.","placed","at","end","(possibly","before","next","\"{pi'e}\")","scope","effect","extends","there,","through","microdigits,","beginning","number","whole","most","recent","(whichsoever","was","more","recently","uttered).","followed","(or","strung","together","connectives)","has","specification","terminate","with","regard,","works","syntactically","semantically","exactly","like","{ju'au}.","fact,","can","outside","order","specify","instead","were","la",".tsonais.,","would","not","needed)","only","sequence","have","been","argument","(such","sequence)","other","than","decimal","desired","then","used.","one","appears","equivalent","short,","contiguous","influences","their","into","same","way","does.","both","how","interpret","(composed","overrides","(but","macrodigit)","thus,","macrodigits","quinary","except","one,","speaker","via","word,","because","they","know","did","want","convert","(because","may","too","large","hard","do","so","easily),","expressed","decimal.","experimental","cmavo","juhuhi","w'en","eit'er","t'e","t'at","(t'is","w'ic'","mig't","tso'nai","eac'","t'is","t'ere,","t'roug'","w'ole","(w'ic'soever","toget'er","'as","wit'","'owever,","'ave","(suc'","ot'er","t'an","t'en","s'ort,","t'eir","bot'","'ow","t'us,","t'ey","'ard","long","digit","pi'e","clarity","ju'au","timekeeping","60","however","example","there","whichsoever","uttered","connectives","regard","fact","tsonais","needed","such","short","does","composed","thus","easily","t'ere","w'ic'soever","'owever","suc'","s'ort","t'us"]},{"w":"dei'ei","bangu":"en","d":"pro-sumti: this entire document/text","n":"Similar to {dei}, but refers to the entire text.

The ith term in tuple X2 is replaced with the ith term in tuple X3; the replacements are executed simultaneously (thus, no overlap/contradiction can be allowed to arise in the substitution- in particular, in X2)  - alternatively, if there is overlap/conflict in/between the terms of X2, the replacements are performed in order of presentation (the ith term in X2 is replaced by the ith term in X3, and then the (i+1)th term in X2 is replaced with the (i+1)th term in X3, starting with the 1st term in each). X2 and X3 must have the same length/number of terms - alternatively, X3 cannot be longer/have more terms than X2; in this situation, the ith term of X2 is replaced with the ith term of X3 until and including when the last term of X3 is reached, after which point the remaining terms in X2 are not replaced at all. Use a permutation acting on X2 as the argument for X3 in order to rearrange the substrings of X1; if the alphabet is ordered, then operators can be applied to the letters in order to rotate through the alphabet. In particular, if X1 is a binary string (a word over an alphabet of two letters) and X2 is the 2-tuple of the letters of that binary alphabet (length-1 substrings), then without specification of X3, this operator defaults to bitwise binary negation (bit conjugation) wherein each letter in X1 is replaced by the unique other letter in the binary alphabet (otherwise, the replacement would be the identity/trivial replacement or just a formal substitution letter-by-letter which does not really change the nature of the word). X1 and each entry in X2 and X3 should be quoted, match a necessary type (such as being a character), or be abstracted a level by symbolics. In general, the replacement is formal and the strings in X3 need not be over the same alphabet as the one over which X1 is written. This operator is useful for combinatorial lines and for expanding digits (such as, in a binary string, replacing each occurrence of \"0\" with \"01\" and each occurrence of \"1\" with \"10\"; note that the replacement is instantaneous and simultaneous for all terms of X2 and every occurrence of such terms in X1, thus this substitution is perfectly acceptable).","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"VUhU","g":"bit conjugation;bitwise binary negation;combinatorial line;digit expansion;find-and-replace","cache":["bai'i","mekso","string","operator","(ternary):","find-and-replace","in","string/text/word/sequence","x1","formally","replace","x2","(ordered","tuple","of","terms","to","be","replaced)","with","x3","respectively","substituted)","and","are","ordered","tuples","substrings/letters/characters/letterals/digits/numerals.","the","ith","term","is","replaced","replacements","executed","simultaneously","(thus,","no","overlap/contradiction","can","allowed","arise","substitution-","particular,","x2)","-","alternatively,","if","there","overlap/conflict","in/between","x2,","performed","order","presentation","(the","by","x3,","then","(i+1)th","starting","1st","each).","must","have","same","length/number","cannot","longer/have","more","than","this","situation,","until","including","when","last","reached,","after","which","point","remaining","not","at","all.","use","a","permutation","acting","on","as","argument","for","rearrange","substrings","alphabet","ordered,","operators","applied","letters","rotate","through","alphabet.","binary","(a","word","over","an","two","letters)","2-tuple","that","(length-1","substrings),","without","specification","defaults","bitwise","negation","(bit","conjugation)","wherein","each","letter","unique","other","(otherwise,","replacement","would","identity/trivial","or","just","formal","substitution","letter-by-letter","does","really","change","nature","word).","entry","should","quoted,","match","necessary","type","(such","being","character),","abstracted","level","symbolics.","general,","strings","need","one","written.","useful","combinatorial","lines","expanding","digits","as,","string,","replacing","occurrence","\"0\"","\"01\"","\"1\"","\"10\"","note","instantaneous","simultaneous","all","every","such","x1,","thus","perfectly","acceptable).","experimental","cmavo","vuhu","bit","conjugation","line","digit","expansion","wit'","substrings/letters/c'aracters/letterals/digits/numerals.","t'e","it'","(t'us,","t'ere","(t'e","t'en","(i+1)t'","eac').","'ave","lengt'/number","longer/'ave","t'an","t'is","w'en","reac'ed,","w'ic'","alp'abet","t'roug'","alp'abet.","t'at","(lengt'-1","wit'out","w'erein","eac'","ot'er","(ot'erwise,","c'ange","s'ould","matc'","(suc'","c'aracter),","suc'","t'us","vu'u","ternary","find","text","sequence","substituted","characters","letterals","numerals","overlap","contradiction","particular","alternatively","conflict","between","i","1","th","length","number","longer","situation","reached","2","otherwise","identity","trivial","quoted","character","symbolics","general","written","0","01","10","acceptable","c'aracters","t'","lengt'","reac'ed","ot'erwise","c'aracter"]},{"w":"me'oi","bangu":"en","d":"non-Lojban brivla","n":"Quick way to borrow foreign words into Lojban.

Inside the module formed by the \"sei'au\" brackets, at most three sumti (where this counting contracts connected sumti into one) can be specified. The first one is a {mau'au}-{zai'ai} quoted function (which is taken to be the operand of this word); it must be preceded (not necessarily immediately) by {li}; let f be this function. The second and third sumti each are a nonnegative integer (preceded by {li}); call them $n$ and $m$ respectively; $n$ defaults to 1 and $m$ defaults to the next (thus-far unfilled) terbri number for/of the current selbri unless these specifications are overridden by zmico; if the relevant selbri has no terbri following this word, then this default value of $m$ causes this word to have no effect. The $m$th terbri of the selbri to which this construct applies will be passed through f before being filled by any sumti (including {zo'e}, explicit or implicit; terbri numbers start counting at 1 and increase by 1 with each new occurrence) for the next $n$ occurrences of the aforementioned selbri in the discourse (with $n$ = 1 counting the current occurrence; aside: a non-default value of $m$ can thus affect the interpretation of an already-filled terbri of the currently open selbri in an afterthought manner); this counting is only done forward in the discourse/time, including the current selbri, never back through it. Thus, $n$ = 0 effectively neutralizes this word, $n$ being infinite causes the effect to be permanent. f being {zi'a'o} returns the terbri in question to its default value/understanding (according to zmico). It is important to realize that this word does not affect the $m$th terbri of all selbri, just of the one currently open when this word is utterred (no matter where it is positioned/nested in future costructs). If this word is in conflict with another usage of this word over the same terbri, follow the specification applied by the most recent still active occurrence of this construct; this construct is considered to be active for this purpose until its-$n$ occurrences of the appropriate terbri are uttered; thus if the earlier-$n$ is greater than the later-$n$, the later effect takes precedent until it is disactivated, after which point the earlier effect resumes. Define $n$ and  $m$ (and f) outside of the module created by brackets of this word if you wish to reuse them; for the sake of future referencing the value specified within the module, $n$ gets reduced/decremented by 1 at each occurrence of the appropriate terbri until it reaches the value 0 (at which value it remains forever after); if $n$ is a series of connected numbers, this decrementation is applied to each connectand in turn. Use {pi'u} (possibly subscripted) in order to simplify utterances. Especially helpful if f is non-injective. The affected terbri must be referenced by {ce'u} as an operand of f wheresoever it is desired; this reference must be explicit.  Let 'broda' be the currentry open selbri; then this word replaces $broda_m$ with f($broda_m$) in the definition of 'broda' for the next $n$ occurrences of the terbri. For example, if f were {cu'a}, then any sumti which fills $broda_m$ will be understood to be doing so in absolute value.

This color is a subset/element (depending on interpretation/usage) of the colors associated with light in the radio and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Speaker determines how close \"approximately twenty-one centimeters\" is to exactly twenty-one centimeters. Technically can only be used for the coloration of light that would arise from the hyperfine spin-flip transition of a hydrogen atom (without any neutrons) in which the proton-electron quantum spin configuration abruptly changes from parallel to antiparallel in the 1s groundstate.  But other isotopes and/or hydrogenic (id est: single-electron) atoms can be referenced by semantic broadening; note that in any case, this word always refers to the color of the light emitted from such an object. This is a color, not a description of the process, conditions under which the light of this color is emitted, etc., nor is it the light itself nor wavelength of the light.  However, this term probably will come up in all such descriptions.  For example, \"hyperfine spin-flip transition\" might be rendered {xipfne binxo}. Technically, any object that emits photons with wavelengths of approximately twenty-one centimeters will be of the color xipfne, regardless of why such emission is occurring (id est: it need not be due to hydrogen hyperfine, proton/electron spin-flip transitions).  Usage in such a case is perfectly acceptable.  However, in practice, such occasions/contexts will be rare (essentially completely absent except in theory) and the only common usage will be in the context of hydrogen hyperfine proton/electron spin-flip transitions (as in astronomy, chemistry, or quantum mechanics). This is an electromagnetic (id est: light, photon) color.  It is physical (being derived from the properties of the wavelength of the emitted and received photon(s)), but is interpreted by some instrument (such as a telescope/camera system, an animal's optical system, etc.).

The entry for this cmavo compound is essentially a proposal to redefine the {va'i} spectrum slightly, to make it a little more like the similar discursive {ta'u}. Consider the English sentences: (A) \"Gold has atomic number 79, in other words, there are 79 protons in a gold nucleus.\" (B) \"There are 79 protons in a gold nucleus, in other words, gold has atomic number 79.\" In English, in both A and B, the parts are discursively connected by the same \"in other words\" connective, even though the connection is in two mutually opposite directions. To understand that there really is a difference between the two, consider another pair of sentences: (A') \"According to the Bible, God made the world in six days, in other words, it took almost a week to make everything around us.\" (B') \"According to the Bible, it took almost a week to make everything around us, in other words, God made the world in six days.\" Unlike A and B, from among the pair A' and B', only A' makes sense, B' sounds absurd. The proposal is to redefine Lojban's {va'i} and {va'i} {nai}, in the motivation to give {va'i} {nai} more of a use, to reflect this very Lojbanic difference in direction, which English cannot capture. This compound, i.e. \"va'i cu'i\" would then acquire the meaning of \"in the same words\". There is no set in stone rule for which of {va'i} and {va'i} {nai} stands for which direction for any given two pair of sentences: however, if one of them is used to connect them in one way, then the other one would connect them in the reverse order. \"broda .i va'i nai brode\" simply is defined as equivalent to \"brode .i va'i broda\".
