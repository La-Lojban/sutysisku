For example in English: \"I ain't seen nothin'\" means that the speaker is very emphatically claiming to have seen nothing of interest. This is the standard operation for negation in Spanish. \"Multiplicative negation\" means that negatives cancel, but do not intensify, one another (possibly taking a neutral or abstentional state). \"I did not see nothing\" in this mode means that the speaker did indeed see something. Note that multiplicative double-negatives are not necessarily equivalent to affirmatives in general. \"I like cheese\" is an affirmative statement and is not equivalent to \"I do not dislike cheese\", which is a multiplicative double-negative (and which may indicate a reluctant acceptance of cheese or a neutral feeling toward cheese). In this mode, an even number of negatives in a given statement is not negative and an odd number of negatives in a given statement is not positive. This word applies to all negatives in the text, whether they are free words or rafsi. This word also, but less dramatically, applies to affirmations: in additive mode, multiple affirmatives intensify one another (\"I am indeed very much so going!\" is a strongly emphasized positive statement); in multiplicative mode, they simply reduce to a single affirmation (for like example, \"I am going\"). This means that care must be taken: In additive mode, an affirmative marker will partially cancel with a negative particle in some way, reducing its intensity and possibly bringing it to a neutral statement (\"I am indeed - not - going\" is a neutral statement in this mode, similar to \"I may be going\"; English does not really have the ability to express such things); in multiplicative mode, an affirmative coupled with a negative simply reduces to the negative, possibly strengthened by a factor equivalent to the intensity of the affirmer (\"I am indeed not going\" is a clear way of saying that the speaker will not go).","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"NEIhAI","g":["double-negative mode toggle"]},{"w":"nei'au","d":"unary mekso operator: $(-1)^x$","n":"Macro for exponentiating -1 by the input, which is an extremely common term.

Making Type 4 {fu'ivla} (or {zi'evla}), on the other hand, presents the challenge of knowing, out of hundreds of wordlike phonological patterns, which will parse as  single-morpheme words and which will not. (For example, the nonce word {kadvati} will parse but *{kazvati} will not; {fra'aso} will but *{fra'asoi} will not; {kadnazbakai} will but {kadnazbackai} is a actually a lujvo.) Making Type 3 fu'ivla is comparatively easy, but still requires knowing how to use hyphen phonemes right and, of course, how to not violate phonotactical rules when lojbanizing foreign words.

If $m$ is defined, then its contextless default value is $m = 0$. This function/word first determines the base being used for interpretation of digit strings (determined by context or by explicit specification (JUhAU)) for/as applied to $x$; this determination takes place even before inputs are accepted after $x$; let this base be represented by $b$ throughout this description unless $b$ is explicitly specified as an input. In such case, if the base of $x$ is a positional system wherein each digit represents a corresponding multiple of a fixed natural number raised to the power of its position (as determined relative to the radix point) and wherein the overall number is the sum of these results/representands, or if $b$ is explicitly specified as an input, then $t$ is defined; if the base of $x$ is sufficiently bad or unclear and $b$ is not explicitly specified as an input, then $t$ is undefined. Of course, if $b$ is explicitly specified as an input, then that value (if valid) is the meaning of \"$b$\" throughout this description. If $t$ is undefined, then its slot is automatically and implicitly deleted from this word in that context (so the operator is at-most-3-ary and its input acceptance is terminated by the '$n$' xor '$m$' slot, whichever one is later yet defined (because, assumptively, '$b$' is not explicitly specified); if '$m$' is defined and explicitly uttered when '$t$' is undefined and the '$x$' and '$n$' values have been explicitly specified, then the third input is '$m$') and \"$b^t$\" $=$ \"$b^{(-t)}$\" $= b = 1$ formally for the purposes of this definition (but not necessarily for the base for any digit-to-number interpretation/conversion, particularly on $x$!). If $t$ is defined, then its contextless default value is $t = 0$. The rounding function, determined by $n$, is performed on $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$. If $n = 1$, then the rounding function is the ceiling function: $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the least integer that is greater than or equal to it; in other words, it rounds up. If $n = -1$, then the rounding function is the floor function: $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the greatest integer that is less than or equal to it; in other words, it rounds down. These integers are both determined by the ordering and metric. If $n = 0$, then the rounding function maps $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ to the integer that minimizes the metric distance between itself and $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ if a unique such integer exists (id est: $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the nearest integer, where \"nearest\"-ness is determined according to the order and metric); if no such unique integer exists, then $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the unique integer among these aforementioned options for which there exists an integer $Z$ such that $2Z+m$ is the integer in question; if no unique such integer exists, then the function is undefined. Thus, $n = 0$ produces the commonly used unbiased nearest-integer rounding function. In each of these cases, the output of the rounding function is then multiplied by sgn$(x) b^{t}$. Thus, it rounds at the $t$th digit if $b$ matches the base of $x$ and else to the nearest multiple of $b$ in the $t$th digit of abs$(x)$, so to speak. Notice that rounding up or down always is applied to the absolute value, so it is really rounding (positive or negative) infinity-ward or zeroward respectively. The order on, and the operators and metric endowing, the metric space and field of all real numbers is determined by context or by explicit specification. The absolute value function is denoted as \"abs( )\" in the definition, and the signum function sgn is such that sgn$(z) = z/$abs$(z)$ for all real $z:$ abs$(z) > 0$, and sgn$(0) = 0$.","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"VUhU","g":["ceiling function","floor function","nearest integer function","round down","rounding function","round to nearest integer","round up"]},{"w":"ji'i'u'u","d":"mekso, at-most-5-ary; rounding function.

In other words, where \"ji'i'u\" really rounds toward or away from $0$, this word rounds toward negative or positive infinity. The behaviors coincide for nonnegative $x$, but differ for $x < 0$; for example, for $x < 0$, a 'negative-type' rounding for \"ji'i'u\" would round toward $0$, which is actually an increase in value (just decrease in absolute value) while remaining negative, whereas a 'negative-type' rounding here would round toward negative infinity, which is a decrease in value (but an increase in absolute value) while remaining negative.

The construct as a whole syntactically functions as a parenthetical so that mekso may be resumed immediately thereafter without any difficulty. This word attaches to/affects the immediately preceding macrodigit string extending from the last evaluated number, number operation, etc. or bracket to/until this word. The preceding number is semantically interpreted according to the description to which the following sumti refers. If a sequence is supplied as the following sumti, the preceding number is interpreted so that each digit, starting from the left (default: see next), is understood as a multiple of the corresponding value in the sequence under the ordering given (which may produce an invalid/ill-formed result; the placement of {pi} matters as well).  If a single number is submitted (such as \"li {dau}\"), this word acts as {ju'u}; the number is interpreted according to the rules of mekso and is its own island for such interpretation (thus {ju'u} is needed to override a cultural/grammatical default interpretation, such as decimal, even if this is done within the mekso expression outside of and including the scope of this word). In this way, the sumti being (10^n)_n, which is a sequence, is the same as the sumti being just 10, but is very different from it being the sequence (10)_n.  The original default for numeral-position/string reading/interpretation is from left-to-right, where a digit on the left in a pair of digits represents that multiple of a \"later\" term in the sequence as compared to right member of the pair; thus \"23\" in decimal means (2*(10^1)) + (3*(10^0)), which is twenty-three.  This default may be overridden via specification of the sequence (either its ordering, its domain being negated, or alteration to the base); alternatively, and perhaps more easily, the appearance of \"la'e zoi jbo. ri'u bi'o zu'a .jbo\" will always reverse it (this is a special input value with interpretation defined by this grammar); when reversed, \"23\" in decimal means (2*(10^0)) + (3*(10^1)), which is to say thirty-two.

Technically, lo prejume cannot really prejumydu'a something else - English conflates \"infect\" as in \"Harry (a person) infected Ron (another person) with the flu\" with \"infect\" as in \"the flu infected Ron\"/\"Ron was infected by the flu\" (where the point of origination is not of focus, merely the fact that the flu is spreading throughout Ron's body).","t":"lujvo","g":["exchange contagion","get someone sick","give contagion to","infect","spread contagion","spread virus"]},{"w":"prejumydu'a'y'utka","d":"$x_1$ infects a recipient who infects a recipient who infects ... who infects recipient $x_2$ with contagion $x_3$ via means of infection/contamination $x_4$ and through intermediaries $x_5$ (ce'o list).; $x_1$ spreads contagion $x_3$ through a network such that they indirectly infect $x_2$ via a route through finitely-many intermediary nodes $x_5$.","n":"This word is a {brapagjvo} of \"{prejumydu'a}\" and \".{utka}\"; each sumti slot should be interpreted as in those words - for example, \"contagion\" is used broadly, as in the definition of \"prejumydu'a\".

An answer is a SE string that is allowed by the selbri and by the subscripts; continuing the example, if the response is 'Ralph went to C from B', one would respond with '.i {setese}'.

Essentially 'se'u'o xi sy' is equivalent to 'se xi li xo poi ke'a cmima sy' (where '{te}' is basically understood as ' se xi li jo'i pa boi ci te'u ', etc.), but the answer can be a complicated ordered sequence/string of SE words; this word complements specifically {fi'a} in the typical/same way that SE complements FA.

By default, the macrodigit is interpreted as being written/expressed in some cultural or grammatical default (this default is overridden by {ju'au} if its specifying sumti requires an alternative interpretation for the value of the macrodigits), probably decimal- the interpretation of the string of microdigits produces a number, x; the \"{pi'e}\" implies the denominator to be used in determining the fraction for which x is in the numerator and context or possibly a specified base determines its value- in timekeeping, the interpretation is typically x/60 for certain macrodigits. However, the default for determining the value of x given a string of microdigits might be useful to override (for example, Tsohnai uses an overall factorial base but each macrodigit is written in balanced quinary); this word specifies the base used for interpreting the macrodigit from a string of microdigits. It is placed at the end of the string (possibly before the next \"{pi'e}\") and its scope of effect extends from there, through the string of microdigits, to either the beginning of the number as a whole or the most recent \"{pi'e}\" (whichsoever was more recently uttered). It is to be followed by a sumti (or multiple sumti strung together by connectives) and has its scope of specification terminate with that sumti; in this regard, it works syntactically and semantically exactly like {ju'au}. In fact, {ju'au} can be used outside of the number in order to specify the macrodigit interpretation instead of this word (for example, if its sumti were la .tsonais., this word would not be needed); however, if only a sequence were to have been given as the argument of {ju'au} (such as the factorial sequence) and if some base other than decimal were desired for the interpretation of each macrodigit from the string of microdigits, then this word would be used. If only one macrodigit appears in the number, then this word is equivalent to {ju'au}. In short, the scope of this word is one contiguous string of microdigits, and it influences their interpretation into a macrodigit value in the same way that {ju'au} does. However, if both {ju'au} and this word specify how to interpret a given string of microdigits in the same number (composed of macrodigits), this word overrides the interpretation specified by {ju'au} (but only for this macrodigit); thus, for example, a Tsohnai number can have each of its macrodigits be interpreted in balanced quinary except one, which the speaker specifies via this word, because they know the value but did not want to convert it to balanced quinary (because it may be too large or hard to do so easily), so they instead expressed it in decimal.","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"JUhUhI","g":["long-digit interpretation specifier","macrodigit named base specifier"]},{"w":"ka'ei","d":"abstractor: predicate abstractor. $x_1$ is the predicate expressed by [bridi], using bo'a, bo'e, etc for variables.","n":"Identical in meaning to an n-ary {ka}, but with lambda-variables bound to {bo'a}/{bo'e}/{bo'i}/{bo'o}/{bo'u} ({bo'ai} for additional variables) instead of {ce'u} (which may still be used for \"next place\").

The number of polytope 'tiles' used can be specified in the third of fifth terbri as desired; the polytopes used need not all be the same, nor regular, so long as the arrangement is meaningful and possible. One of the main differences between rectangular polyplets and polyominoes is that polyominoes cannot have their polytope tiles touching only at their vertices whereas polyplets can (thus, polyominoes are a subset of the rectangular polyplets); this difference can be specified in the final terbri. A tiling of a space may be considered to be an infinite polyform, but that is rather pathological and we can reasonably assume that polyforms referenced by this word will be finite. The polyform is considered to be a unified whole entity. The ambient space is usually going to be the Euclidean space of the same dimension as the polytopes (and the former dimension cannot be exceeded by the latter except in the marginal case of lower-dimensional (id est: hyperplanar) arrangements, in which case parallel cross-sections are really being considered); this space determines the rigid-motion/symmetry isomorphisms of various polyforms (Z and S tetraminoes are non-isomorphic under rigid-motion in the Euclidean plane but are so isomorphic in Euclidean 3-space). The ambient space also determines the expression of (and indeed the 'allowed') polytopes: spherical geometry allows for digons to be arranged so as to form a polyform, but Euclidean 2-space prohibits such objects from the set of possible polygons. The default polytope will probably be a 2-dimensional square; thus the default ambient space will likely be Euclidean 2-space.
