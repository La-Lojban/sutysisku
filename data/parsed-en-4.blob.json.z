The only commonality guaranteed in $x_2$ is $x_3$; the only commonality in $x_1$ is a lack of $x_3$; these each are their sole respective defining features.

Make sure to convert $x_3$ from an operator to a sumti; $x_3$ is the 'f' in \"f-mean\" and must be a complex-valued, single-valued function which is defined and continuous on $x_2$ and which is injective; it defaults to the $p$th-power function ($z^p$) for some nonzero $p$ (note that it need not be positive or an integer) and indeterminate/variable/input $z$, or $log$, or $exp$ (as functions); culture or context can further constrain the default. If $x_2$ is set to \"$z^{+ \\infty .}$\" (the exponent is positive infinity, given by \"{ma'uci'i}\") for indeterminate/variable $z$ (the function is the functional limit of the monic, single-term polynomial as the degree increases without bound), then the result ($x_1$) is the weight-sum-scaled maximum of the products of the data (terms of $x_2$) with their corresponding weights (terms of $x_4$) according to the standard ordering on the set of all real numbers or possibly some other specified or assumed ordering; likewise, if $x_2$ is set to \"$z^{- \\infty .}$\" (the exponent is negative infinity, given by \"{ni'uci'i}\") for indeterminate/variable $z$ (the function is the functional limit of the monic, single-term reciprocal-polynomial as the reciprocal-degree increases without bound (or the degree decreases without bound)), then the result ($x_1$) is the weight-sum-scaled minimum of the products of the data (terms of $x_2$) with their corresponding weights (terms of $x_4$) according to the standard ordering on the set of all real numbers or possibly some other specified or assumed ordering. The default of $x_4$ is the ordered set of $n$ terms with each term equal identically to $1/n$, where the cardinality of $x_2$ is $n$. Let \"$f$\" denote the sumti in $x_3$, \"$y_i$\" denote the $i$th term in $x_2$ for all $i$, \"$n$\" denote the cardinality of $x_2$ (thus also $x_4$), and \"$w_i$\" denote the $i$th term in $x_4$ for any $i$; then the result $x_1$ is equal to: $f^{(-1)}($Sum$(w_i f(y_i), i$ in Set$(1,...,n)) / $Sum$(w_i, i$ in Set$(1,...,n)))$. Note that if the weights are all $1$ and $x_2$ is set equal to not the $p$th-power function, but instead the $p$th-power function left-composed with the absolute value function (or the forward difference function), then the result is the $p$-norm on $x_2$ scaled by $n^{(-1/p)}$ for integer $n$ being the cardinality of $x_2$. This should typically not refer to the mean of a function ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_of_a_function ), although it generalizes easily; alternatively, with appropriate weighting, allow $x_2$ to be the image (set) of the function whose average is desired over the entire relevant subset of its domain - notice that the weights will have to themselves be functions of the data or the domain of the function; in this context, the function is not necessarily $x_3$. If $x_3$ is a single extended-real number $p$ (not a function), then this word refers to the weighted power-mean and it is equivalent to letting $x_2$ equal the $p$th-power function as before iff $p$ is nonzero real, the $max$ or $min$ as before if $p$ is infinite (according to its signum as before), and $log$ if $p=0$ (thus making the overall mean refer to the geometric mean); this overloading is for convenience of usage and will not cause confusion because constant functions are very much so not injective.","arithmetic mean;average;generalized f-mean;generalized mean;geometric mean;harmonic mean;log-sum-exponential;LSE;max;mean;mean value;min;norm;norm;p-norm;power mean;quasi-arithmetic mean;RMS;root-mean-square;typical","a|1nJ","(li","number/quantity)","weighted","quasi-arithmetic","mean/generalized","f-mean","of/on","(completely","multiset/list)","(defaults","extended-real","s|number,","particular","interpretation","notes)","weights","multiset/list","cardinality/length","notes).","potentially","dimensionful.","make","sure","convert","'f'","\"f-mean\"","s|complex-valued,","single-valued","continuous","injective","$p$th-power","($z^p$)","nonzero","$p$","(note","integer)","indeterminate/variable/input","s|$z$,","s|$log$,","$exp$","functions)","further","constrain","default.","\"$z^{+","\\infty",".}$\"","exponent","s|infinity,","\"{ma'uci'i}\")","indeterminate/variable","$z$","functional","s|monic,","single-term","polynomial","degree","increases","s|bound),","result","($x_1$)","weight-sum-scaled","maximum","products","(terms","$x_2$)","corresponding","$x_4$)","assumed","s|likewise,","\"$z^{-","\"{ni'uci'i}\")","reciprocal-polynomial","reciprocal-degree","s|bound)),","minimum","ordering.","$n$","identically","s|$1/n$,","$n$.","\"$f$\"","denote","\"$y_i$\"","$i$th","s|$i$,","\"$n$\"","(thus","s|$x_4$),","\"$w_i$\"","$i$","$f^{(-1)}($sum$(w_i","s|f(y_i),","i$","s|set$(1,...,n))","s|$sum$(w_i,","s|set$(1,...,n)))$.","$1$","s|function,","left-composed","forward","s|function),","$p$-norm","scaled","$n^{(-1/p)}$","integer","mean","(","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mean_of_a_function","s|),","generalizes","easily","s|alternatively,","s|weighting,","allow","image","whose","average","desired","entire","relevant","notice","will","s|context,","power-mean","letting","iff","$max$","$min$","infinite","(according","signum","s|before),","$log$","$p=0$","making","overall","geometric","mean)","overloading","convenience","cause","confusion","constant","injective.","arithmetic","harmonic","log-sum-exponential","lse","max","min","p-norm","power","rms","root-mean-square","weig'ted","quasi-arit'metic","weig'ts","cardinality/lengt'","$p$t'-power","furt'er","weig't-sum-scaled","$i$t'","(t'us","'ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mean_of_a_function","s|weig'ting,","w'ose","arit'metic","'armonic","quasi","completely","multiset","extended","dimensionful","valued","th","indeterminate","variable","log","exp","infty","infinity","ma'uci'i","monic","weight","sum","likewise","ni'uci'i","y_i","w_i","left","https","wikipedia","wiki","mean_of_a_function","alternatively","weighting","exponential","square","t'","weig't","'ttps","weig'ting","a|1nJ|d|1nO|1nP|e|o|1nQ|1nR|1nS|1nT|1nU|2|n|1nV|qW|fJ|1nW|4D|gJ|AQ|1nX|YB|2g|1h3|eL|BU|AW|1nY|1nZ|eQ|I3|f|1na|1nb|1nc|2P|1nd|PM|1ne|6d|1nf|43|BN|1ng|1nh|1ni|1nj|1nk|1nl|2j|10H|Z2|1nm|50|1nn|55|W2|7t|1no|1np|j|O2|1nq|7b|1nr|1ns|1nt|3S|Vt|1nu|1nv|1nw|5M|BS|q|BO|5L|1nx|1ny|1nz|1o0|1o1|1lV|1o2|1A9|gq|Ay|1o3|1o4|1o5|AM|1o6|1o7|1o8|qR|1o9|1oA|p0|1O|1oB|1oC|1oD|1oE|1ic|h|1oF|1oG|1oH|1oI|1oJ|B0|1oK|1oL|1oM|1oN|1oO|1oP|1oQ|1oR|1hQ|1oS|1oT|2B|q4|W0|c3|cM|x5|P3|1oU|1oV|1oW|kj|1oX|1oY|1oZ|C9|5I|N9|1oa|1ob|1oc|Bx|1od|YU|By|5A|qs|1oe|1of|Xf|wj|1og|1aU|1oh|1oi|3V|1oj|1ok|1ol|1om|1on|4J|1oo|1op|OL|1oq|1Co|1or|1os|1ot|1ou|7l|1ov|1ow|13L|76|1ox|1oy|6Y|Md|1oz|5S|gI|1p0|1la|1p1|1p2|1p3|1p4|1p5|146|Ju|7X|Ad|1mJ|1fJ|1p6|1p7|1p8|1p9|Oz|1pA|1pB|1pC|1Bv|1pD|1pE|1pF|AN|1pG|1pH|1pI|E8|1pJ|1pK|wt|51|gK|1lQ|1pL|1pM|Aj|Vv|1BE|1pN|13Z|8M|4A|c2|1f2|7Y|49|1pO|5J|1pP|13k|1pQ|13a|1pR|1pS|1pT|1pU|1pV|1pW|1pX|1pY|1pZ|1pa|1pb|1pc|1pd|1pe|1AQ|1pf|1pg|Av|1ph|8T|Ah|BB|1pi|19R|1pj|1Ce|1pk|1pl|1pm|1pn|1po|H5|1pp|1pq|1pr|1ps|kq|x|1pt|1pu|eZ|IL|2U|1pv|1pw|v|1px|5q|1py|qi|Bp|1pz|1hs|P8|CJ|Xk|1q0|1q1|7d|Bf|1q2|P7|1q3|1q4|Bk|W8|Bi|1q5|1q6|z|rn|8d|1q7|L4|10|1q8|1q9|f4|3j|1qA|Fh|FQ|1qB|c7|1qC|6E|1qD|gh|1qE|1qF|1ek|1qG|1qH|1qI|1qJ|1qK|1qL|1qM|1qN|1qO|1qP|1fP|S|L0|1qQ|oZ|CI|1qR|1qS|Rh|1qT|Y|1qU|pm|1qV|1qW|1qX|1qY|Aw|1qZ|8i|1qa|Ff|1qb|1qc|CM|1qd|1qe","o|19N|1nJ|Y|1nK|1nL|19R|1nM|1nN|1qf","cnanlagau","$x_1$ is the generalized arithmetic-geometric mean of the elements of the 2-element set $x_2$ (set; cardinality must be 2) of order $x_3$ (either single extended-real number xor an unordered pair/2-element set of extended-real numbers).","s|Elements of $x_2$ must have the same units/dimensionality; the result has the same units/dimensionality as them. If $x_3=p$ for a single extended-real number $p$, then $x_3=(p,p-1)$ also. If $x_3 = (p,q)$ then the algorithm uses the $p$th-power mean ({cnanfadi}) and the $q$th-power mean; thus $x_3 = (1,0)$ corresponds to the standard arithmetic-geometric mean, $x_3 = (0, -1)$ corresponds to the geometric-harmonic mean. A poor choice of $x_3$ will lead to non-convergence of the sequences produced by the algorithm and, thus, leave $x_1$ undefined (NAN error). $x_1$ is the value to which each of the sequences produced by the algorithm converge (iff these values are mutually equal). Let $M_i$ denote the unweighted $i$th-power mean for all $i$ and let $x_2 = (a_0,g_0),$ $x_3 = (p,q)$; then the algorithm produces potentially infinite sequences $a = (a_0, a_1, ...), g = (g_0, g_1, ...)$, where $a_n = M_p(a_{(n-1)}, g_{(n-1)}), g_n = M_q(a_{(n-1)}, g_{(n-1)})$ for all positive integers $n$. Notice that this word is symmetric ($x_1$ remains constant and none of the sumti change in meaning) under an internal permutation of the elements/entries of $x_2$ and/or of $x_3$ (when taken as a pair or set), separately.

When the argument of $x_4$ is 1, the generalized eigenspace $x_3$ is simply a strict/simple/basic eigenspace; this is the typical (and probable cultural default) meaning of this word. $x_4$ will typically be restricted to integer values k > 0. $x_2$ should always be specified (at least implicitly by context), for an eigenvalue does not mean much without the linear transformation being known. However, since one usually knows the said linear transformation, and since the basic underlying relationship of this word is \"eigen-ness\", the eigenvalue is given the primary terbri ($x_1$). When filling $x_3$ and/or $x_4$, $x_2$ and $x_1$ (in that order of importance) should already be (at least contextually implicitly) specified. $x_3$ is the set of all eigenvectors of linear transformation $x_2$, endowed with all of the typical operations of the vector space at hand. The default includes the zero vector (else the $x_3$ eigenspace is not actually a vector space); normally in the context of mathematics, the zero vector is not considered to be an eigenvector, but by this definition it is included. Thus, a Lojban mathematician would consider the zero vector to be an (automatic) eigenvector of the given (in fact, any) linear transformation (particularly ones represented by a square matrix in a given basis). This is the logically most basic definition, but is contrary to typical mathematical culture. This word implies neither nondegeneracy nor degeneracy of eigenspace $x_3$. In other words there may or may not be more than one linearly independent vector in the eigenspace $x_3$ for a given eigenvalue $x_1$ of linear transformation $x_2$. $x_3$ is the unique generalized eigenspace of $x_2$ for given values of $x_1$ and $x_4$. $x_1$ is not necessarily the unique eigenvalue of linear transformation $x_2$, nor is its multiplicity necessarily 1 for the same. Beware when converting the terbri structure of this word. In fact, the set of all eigenvalues for a given linear transformation $x_2$ will include scalar zero (0); therefore, any linear transformation with a nontrivial set of eigenvalues will have at least two eigenvalues that may fill in terbri $x_1$ of this word. The 'eigenvalue' of zero for a proper/nice linear transformation will produce an 'eigenspace' that is equivalent to the entire vector space at hand. If $x_3$ is specified by a set of vectors, the span of that set should fully yield the entire eigenspace of the linear transformation $x_2$ associated with eigenvalue $x_1$, however the set may be redundant (linearly dependent); the zero vector is automatically included in any vector space. A multidimensional eigenspace (that is to say a vector space of eigenvectors with dimension strictly greater than 1) for fixed eigenvalue and linear transformation (and generalization exponent) is degenerate by definition. The algebraic multiplicity $x_5$ of the eigenvalue does not entail degeneracy (of eigenspace) if greater than 1; it is the integer number of occurrences of a given eigenvalue $x_1$ in the multiset of eigenvalues (spectrum) of the given linear transformation/square matrix $x_2$. In other words, the characteristic polynomial can be factored into linear polynomial primes (with root $x_1$) which are exponentiated to the power $x_5$ (the multiplicity; notably, not $x_4$). For $x_4$ > $x_5$, the eigenspace is trivial. $x_2$ may not be diagonalizable. The scalar zero (0) is a naturally permissible argument of $x_1$ (unlike some cultural mathematical definitions in English). Eigenspaces retain the operations and properties endowing the vectorspaces to which they belong (as subspaces). Thus, an eigenspace is more than a set of objects: it is a set of vectors such that that set is endowed with vectorspace operators and properties. Thus {klesi} alone is insufficient. But the set underlying eigenspace $x_3$ is a type of {klesi}, with the property of being closed under linear transformation $x_2$ (up to scalar multiplication). The vector space and basis being used are not specified by this word.

A bound on a function is really a bound on the image (set; $x_2$) of the function's domain set under the operation of the function; otherwise, it is sumti-raising. $x_3$ accepts either a directional vector (normalized) / a point on the unit circle (in which case the direction from the origin to that point is the direction which is being considered), or exactly one of li {ma'u} and li {ni'u}; it is unlikely that any other input would be acceptable.  \"{ma'u}\" causes the bound to be an upper bound (a bound on the positive side or the 'right'/'above' when plotted using typical Western European conventions) - it is a number which exceeds/is greater than or equal to every element of $x_2$ in the set underlying $x_4$ according to the order endowing $x_4$. \"{ni'u}\" causes the bound to be an lower bound (a bound on the negative side or the 'left'/'below' when plotted using typical Western European conventions) - it is a number which is less than or equal to every element of $x_2$ in the set underlying $x_4$ according to the order endowing $x_4$. In order to be well-defined, all elements of $x_2$ united with the singleton of $x_1$ must be ordered according to the ordering endowing $x_4$; if $x_4$ lacks a good order, then $x_1$ is undefined. $x_4$ must be an ordered structure, not simply a set. Warning: If $x_3$ is explicitly filled, that is the only direction which is to be assumed.  If it is not explicitly filled, only one (or, arguably, possibly zero) direction(s) is(/are) to be assumed; in this context, it is to be inferred that the set $x_2$ is (possibly) bounded on at least one side/in at least one direction.  Connecting arguments by 'AND' in $x_3$ implies that $x_2$ is the set formed by the singleton of $x_3$; it is NOT the equivalent to the English term \"bound(ed)\" without qualifiers/adjectives (for that meaning, use modulus/absolute value/norm on the input of $x_1$). The bound is not strict (proposal: use {praperi} for this sense), but must be true of all elements of $x_2$ in that direction ($x_3$); it is not necessarily the extremal/best finite bound on $x_2$. $x_1$ is typically finite; submitting any infinity for it is arguably bad form but would imply that no element of $x_2$ is infinite on the side determined by $x_3$ (where \"infinite\" has meaning determined also by $x_4$; again, for \"finite\", use modulus/absolute value/norm) - no other information (about its being bounded or unbounded) can be discerned (unless the sumti in $x_3$ and/or $x_4$ are incompatible). For explicit statement of unboundedness (in a more general sense, possibly including ill-definition of what \"boundedness\" even means in this context) in the direction determined by $x_3$, use {zi'au} as the sumti of $x_1$ (confer earlier note about compatibility of definition and ordering of $x_4$ with $x_2$). $x_4$ can be more exotic than simply the field of real numbers.","bounded set;lower bound;set of only finite elements;unbounded set;upper bound","a|2Xf","(li)","bounds","side","bounded","proper)","contain","s|infinite,","general.","function's","s|otherwise,","sumti-raising.","accepts","directional","(normalized)","circle","s|considered),","{ma'u}","{ni'u}","unlikely","acceptable.","\"{ma'u}\"","'right'/'above'","plotted","conventions)","exceeds/is","every","\"{ni'u}\"","'left'/'below'","s|well-defined,","lacks","s|order,","undefined.","set.","warning:","s|filled,","assumed.","s|(or,","s|arguably,","direction(s)","is(/are)","inferred","(possibly)","side/in","direction.","'and'","\"bound(ed)\"","qualifiers/adjectives","s|meaning,","modulus/absolute","value/norm","$x_1$).","(proposal:","{praperi}","s|sense),","($x_3$)","extremal/best","finite","submitting","arguably","imply","\"infinite\"","s|again,","s|\"finite\",","value/norm)","(about","unbounded)","discerned","(unless","incompatible).","explicit","unboundedness","ill-definition","\"boundedness\"","{zi'au}","(confer","earlier","compatibility","$x_2$).","exotic","unbounded","s|ot'erwise,","'rig't'/'above'","normalized","acceptable","'right'","conventions","exceeds","'left'","'below'","warning","ed","qualifiers","adjectives","modulus","proposal","praperi","extremal","again","incompatible","ill","boundedness","zi'au","confer","'rig't'","a|2Xf|d|2Xk|e|f|C9|7b|AM|n|AN|50|5O|AQ|fJ|69|PM|2Xl|2j|o|2Xm|2Xn|1O|ID|Ad|7t|wt|1f2|13Z|2Xo|h|x4|BU|7s|2Xp|Vc|j|76|2Xq|2Xr|gJ|BE|1pF|1qp|1oR|2Xs|gK|NB|2DI|2Xt|2Xu|2Xv|BK|2Xw|1nC|2Xx|7l|4u|Kz|2Xy|Ii|ah|2k|2g|5M|146|2Xz|5L|ow|ox|rn|2Y0|55|2Y1|2Y2|OL|P3|1ek|1aQ|2Y3|2Y4|Sj|AW|B1|hK|BO|2Y5|4F|2Y6|4D|kq|2EV|1cW|2Y7|1lQ|c2|2Y8|nT|Al|qs|2Y9|YB|1B0|27Y|eK|2YA|ag|kj|2YB|OS|2YC|W0|1qn|OJ|2P|1tm|W2|q4|eL|2YD|C2|2YE|eQ|2YF|wf|q|267|2YG|2YH|2QX|2YI|48|2YJ|2YK|2YL|x5|25e|2YM|2YN|1oU|7X|1pN|2YO|2YP|4s|CC|2YQ|2YR|2SZ|VZ|2YS|1EE|1lM|5J|1fB|5A|2YT|B0|2YU|1ha|2YV|3T|2YW|2YX|2YY|1mE|2YZ|2Ya|3S|2Yb|6Y|b2|2Yc|2Yd|2Ye|Ju|1mJ|2Yf|1qJ|2Yg|C5|Ib|2Yh|b1|1pT|2Qr|XO|2Yi|I3|VY|4J|2Yj|2Yk|2Yl|vN|2Ym|51|2Yn|Ay|2Yo|2Yp|Z2|Iu|2Yq|2Yr|11j|2Ys|qa|qx|2PI|WB|2Yt|xl|2Yu|1E4|1fN|2RM|3V|2Yv|43|2Yw|2Yx|13L|KG|2Yy|PB|2Yz|2Z0|120|c3|kr|19R|2Z1|x|Bf|v|2Z2|Bu|5q|P8|2Z3|4T|Bm|2U|eZ|7d|1g7|Bp|XY|IL|xs|z|10|3j|Fh|x7|1li|2PS|2Z4|OU|ku|ki|2Z5|2Z6|7L|2Z7|2Z8|2Z9|2ZA|14A|O2|1rI|2ZB|1ta|kl|H4|gq|2ZC|2ZD|2ZE|2ZF|5S|gI|H5|2ZG|2ZH|260|2ZI|1EZ|Xf|2ZJ|1iI|2ZK|2ZL|2ZM|2ZN|2ZO|cM|1m9|2ZP|Xk","o|19N|2Xf|Y|2Xg|2Xh|19R|2Xi|2Xj|2ZQ","cektola","$x_1$ is $x_2$ shekels/tolas in mass by standard $x_3$","s|Both are about 11.7 g (the shekel being more variable), and both are derived from a word meaning \"weigh\".","shekel;tola","a|2ZS","shekels/tolas","11.7","shekel","s|variable),","\"weigh\".","tola","s'ekels/tolas","s'ekel","\"weig'\".","shekels","tolas","7","weigh","s'ekels","weig'","a|2ZS|d|e|n|2ZX|50|S7|1O|2B|AQ|13c|76|KG|2ZY|U|qR|2ZZ|146|qa|2Za|55|1VC|2j|f|7Y|VY|2Zb|19R|2Zc|2Zd|13n|qi|2Ze|2Zf|z|10|2Zg|2Zh|3j|UK|2Zi|o|1qF|2Zj|2Zk|x|2Zl","o|19N|2ZS|Y|2ZT|2ZU|19R|2ZV|2ZW|2Zm","cekrti","$x_1$ is a T-shirt made from material $x_2$.","See also: {creka}.","tee;tee-shirt;T-shirt","a|2Zo","{creka}.","tee","tee-shirt","tee-s'irt","a|2Zo|d|e|f|iS|Dr|2j|7q|Ju|4I|8R|2Zt|19R|2Zu|2Zv|iT|2Zw|z|T|iU|10|4J|iR|iV","o|19N|2Zo|Y|2Zp|2Zq|19R|2Zr|2Zs|2Zx","cekrpolo","$x_1$ is a polo shirt of material $x_2$.","s|A T-shaped shirt with a collar, typically a two- or three-button placket, and an optional pocket.

For example, a two-year-old is older than a one-year-old but neither is old by normal human standards. This word says that not only is one thing more than another in some property, but at least one of them does have that property. So, an octagenarian is older than a toddler, and the former (but not the latter) actually is old by normal human standards. In my cases, if $x_4 = 2$, then not only does $x_2$ have property $x_3$, but $x_1$ also has property $x_3$ (just by a greater amount/to a greater extent); it is uncommon and indicative of a pathology in definition for $x_4 = 2$ to not imply that $x_4 = 1$ is also true. The converse is untrue: $x_1$ may have property $x_3$ even while $x_2$ does not ('$x_4 = 1$' is true but '$x_4 = 2$' is false, as in the octagenerian versus toddler example); however, in order to exclude the possibility that $x_4 = 2$ when $x_4 = 1$ is specified, one must explicitly specify that it is so - $x_4$ necessarily tells which argument does indeed satisfy the proposition of having property $x_3$, but it possibly may not necessarily give any information as to which argument does not do so.

Compare to mathematical notation: \"$x_3 \\vdash x_1 : x_2$\", with $x_4$ implied by context. In proof-irrelevant work (e.g, classical logic), this is usually written \"$x_3 \\vdash x_2$\". $x_1$ is most likely to be filled by a {li} construct, or something that potentially reduces to a mathematical expression. Quoted arguments should be dereferenced with {la'e} or similar. $x_1$ can be filled by {zi'o}, which means that the proposition is unprovable. $x_2$ can be filled by a set of which the $x_1$ value is a member. It may be convenient to interpret {lo'i} as the gadri for types. $x_3$ will be a conjunction of {du'u} sumti, each possibly containing a bridi based on {ctaipe}. $x_4$ need not be consistent.

Thus, the indices/labels specified are included in the range of sampling; id est: if the matrix entries listed belong to the ith row and jth column and the (i+n)th row and (j+m)th column respectively (for positive integers i,j,n,m), then the sampling will be conducted in all rows of number between (and including) i and i+n (yielding n+1 sampled rows) and in all columns of number between (and including) j and j+m (yielding m+1 sampled columns). The default diagonal sampling procedure for x4 is as follows: The first sampled entry has the minimum allowed (as specified in x3) indices.  All latter sampled entries (by default) have indices of the immediately previous sampled entry each augmented by 1. (Which is to say that if the kth sampled entry has indices (x,y,...), in that order, then the (k+1)th sampled entry has indices (x+1,y+1,...), in that order and where each subsequent index would be the respective index of the kth sampled entry augmented by 1).  The process terminates generally whenever exactly one entry is sampled from each of the rows, each of the columns, etc. of the tensor.  In the default, the process terminates when at least one of the indices of a sampled entry of the tensor is as large as possible in the range specified by x3. Thus, in order to reconcile the general and the default termination conditions, the range specified by x3 must be compatible with both; id est: it must be a r-dimensional hypercube of entries, so to speak, where r is the rank of tensor x2. The default for sampling range x3 is between and including the entry in the first row and first column (etc.) and the entry in the last row and last column (etc.) for an r-dimensional hypercube tensor (meaning that each row, column, etc. of the tensor has exactly the same number of entries as the others).  Generally, the default range begins with the entry of indices each minimal in the tensor (called 'the first entry') and extends to include (\"draw\") the maximal r-dimensional hypercube of entries in the tensor with one vertex on the first entry; in other words, if the minimum of the set of maximal indices in the tensor is g, then the sampling range is every row between the first and the gth, every column between the first and the gth, etc.  Generally, the sampling range must be an r-dimensional orthotope of some positive size (that is to say: including at least one entry) no larger than the tensor itself, but with the freedom to place at most r of its vertices among the entries thereof; if the default sampling procedure x4 is being used, then the r-dimensional orthotope must be an r-dimensional hypercube. Generalizes to any tensor, but is only interesting for tensors of rank at least 1.

standard $x_4$","s|$x_1$ is increasing in $x_2$ for times/conditions determined by context (use {ca}, {va'o}, vel sim. in order to specify when increase occurs); times/conditions of increase are not necessarily those of attainment of that property (which is specified by $x_3$). If an abstraction is submitted to $x_3$ then the time of event of $x_1$ achieving/attaining property $x_2$ occurs exactly when/simultaneous with when/if the abstraction occurs (if it is an event) or is true (if it is a proposition, notion, truth value, idea, etc.); since it is increasing in that property and achieves it at that time, if the time determined by context is that determined by $x_3$, then for times slightly later than that time will also have $x_1$ having that property but times slightly earlier than that time will not. Numbers submitted to $x_3$ determine the lesser/earlier endpoint of a semi-infinite interval through time such that attainment occurs throughout the interval. If a number is submitted to $x_3$, the options are only li {ni'u}, li {no}, li {ma'u}, and li {ni'u}/{ma'u} {ci'i}; li ni'u ci'i being submitted means that $x_1$ has always been/had $x_2$, it just happens to be increasing in this property too (at the time specified by context); li ni'u (which is taken to be a finite number) means that there was a time prior to the time specified by context such that $x_1$ was/had $x_2$ but such has no always been the case, and also that at the time specified by context, it is increasing in this property; li no means that at the time specified by context, $x_1$ has just attained being/having property $x_2$ and it is also increasing in this respect; li ma'u (which is taken to be a finite positive number) means that $x_1$ is increasing in property $x_2$ at the time determined by context and that it has not yet (at that time) but will eventually (a finite and positive amount of time later) been classified as having that property properly according to $x_4$; li ma'u ci'i means that $x_1$ is increasing in $x_2$ at the time specified by context but that it will never actually manage to achieve having that property according to $x_4$, even if it asymptotically and strictly monotonically approaches that status. The time specified in $x_3$ need not be the time of when $x_1$ is increasing in property $x_2$ (which is specified via {ca} or the like, in the bridi). \"Time\" in the sense of $x_3$ is rather general; for example, it can also just be conditions which were satisfied when attainment is true (such as a subset on which a mathematical function is positive); it is generally an 'IF' statement (id est: attainment might occur at other times or under other conditions). For example, humans, normally, always increase in oldness/age (the context-determined time/conditions of increase in age is (those throughout) the entirety of their life), but are not actually considered old until they reach some age (specified by $x_3$).","increasing in and having attained property","a|46z","(experiencer/function)","increases/gains/is","incremented/augmented","achieves/had","achieved","s|(abstraction,","number)","times/conditions","s|{ca},","s|{va'o},","occurs)","attainment","$x_3$).","submitted","achieving/attaining","occurs","when/simultaneous","when/if","event)","s|notion,","s|value,","s|idea,","slightly","lesser/earlier","endpoint","semi-infinite","interval.","s|{ni'u},","s|{no},","s|{ma'u},","{ni'u}/{ma'u}","{ci'i}","ci'i","been/had","prior","was/had","s|case,","attained","being/having","later)","classified","properly","never","manage","asymptotically","monotonically","approaches","status.","{ca}","s|like,","bridi).","\"time\"","positive)","occur","conditions).","s|humans,","s|normally,","oldness/age","context-determined","time/conditions","age","(those","throughout)","entirety","s|life),","reach","(specified","ac'ieves/'ad","ac'ieved","ac'ieving/attaining","w'en/simultaneous","w'en/if","slig'tly","been/'ad","was/'ad","being/'aving","approac'es","s|'umans,","(t'ose","t'roug'out)","reac'","gains","incremented","had","ca","va'o","achieving","attaining","simultaneous","notion","semi","status","oldness","'ad","ac'ieving","a|46z|d|474|475|476|50|9R|n|I5|5M|BU|477|478|ON|9Z|4s|2q6|AQ|479|47A|YB|2g|2B|PM|e|1zy|3S|47B|2Qr|1O|gq|1Bu|47C|47D|1fn|2Ob|1B0|1zr|4F|Sq|47E|h|76|q|13Z|1E9|47F|qZ|qW|47G|eL|AW|38n|47H|eQ|o|62|61|47I|47J|ow|47K|2P|47L|1hk|47M|5L|b2|f|1aY|47N|1af|47O|47P|wi|26G|55|2db|ua|3V|3Iq|47Q|2wI|Al|1pM|4J|Aj|6Y|2Yx|1DF|cM|2U9|47R|47S|47T|8U|2U5|3S4|47U|c2|3Kv|48|rn|47V|47W|47X|47Y|47Z|ki|47a|146|1fN|I3|26C|47b|i|1iO|1jk|7t|7X|1fl|26D|2RM|1rq|2Ye|wo|29a|47c|47d|b1|2Eh|47e|1pN|47f|47g|1ki|ku|BO|eH|1jm|2qr|hK|9d|47h|47i|43|47j|47k|26X|47l|2Kt|Vs|1E4|47m|wk|47n|47o|47p|BS|2m|47q|47r|47s|47t|260|Ak|qx|1hZ|Ay|NC|j|1aO|1mC|Is|wt|7b|1Ap|gJ|47u|3Y1|3Pn|11j|BP|BQ|MS|47v|P3|NB|47w|47x|47y|47z|qR|480|481|482|483|484|485|1hQ|486|OU|2cu|2Qd|Ai|487|Vt|488|19R|IM|5q|489|48A|Ob|4T|1EU|qk|eZ|x|48B|48C|2U|48D|1b0|2dg|48E|Bm|Bk|2UK|3S8|IL|48F|1jq|7d|wz|48G|48H|2Kv|48I|Bl|v|J2|1BA|MX|P8|48J|qi|48K|48L|1hs|Bj|48M|z|2ga|1oJ|48N|48O|3Xr|8d|10|48P|3j|Fh|3T|48Q|48R|1gg|48S|48T|48U|1b7|48V|gI|Ht|6r|1tj|48W|1pT|ah|48X|xk|12S|c6|CG|CH|6g|OT|48Y|3dk|48Z|48a|6n","o|19N|46z|Y|470|471|19R|472|473|48b","baurnutu'o","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''nto'' (Ntomba).","Ntomba","a|48d","''nto''","(ntomba).","ntomba","a|48d|d|e|o|XK|2P|3ib|3ic|3W2|48h|48i|4I|4J|3ih|19R|48j|x|2U|z|3ij|Ma|Q","o|19N|48d|Y|48e|3iY|19R|48f|48g|48k","baurnutumu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''ntm'' (Nateni).","Nateni","a|48m","''ntm''","(nateni).","nateni","a|48m|d|e|o|XK|2P|3ib|3ic|3W2|48q|48r|4I|4J|3ih|19R|48s|x|2U|z|3ij|Ma|Q","o|19N|48m|Y|48n|3iY|19R|48o|48p|48t","baurnutuku","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''ntk'' (Ikoma-Nata-Isenye).","Ikoma-Nata-Isenye","a|48v","''ntk''","(ikoma-nata-isenye).","ikoma-nata-isenye","ikoma","nata","isenye","a|48v|d|e|o|XK|2P|3ib|3ic|3W2|48z|490|4I|4J|3ih|19R|491|x|2U|z|3ij|Ma|492|493|494|Q","o|19N|48v|Y|48w|3iY|19R|48x|48y|495","au'unmo","$x_1$ finds/emotionally feels $x_2$ to be cute;

For example, \"li pa ce'o li re\" means \"big-endian\" (the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\") comes first in the sequence and the sequence has exactly two terms), \"li re ce'o li pa\" means \"little-endian\" ((the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\") comes last in the sequence and the sequence has exactly two terms), \"li re ce'o li ci ce'o le pa\" is middle-endian (as in the conventional representation of dates in the U.S. (MM-DD-YYYY); the second most signifant term (represented by \"li re\"; example: month) comes first, the least significant term (represented by \"li ci\"; example: day) comes second, and the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\"; example: year) comes last, and there are exactly three terms), \"li pa ce'o li ci ce'o li re\" is the reverse of the last (example: YYYY-DD-MM). The point is that, while it is cumbersome, this method of filling $x_2$ is generalizable and explicit. \"Bi-endian\" (traditional sense) can be specified by a judicious usage of the word \".{a}\" between the little-endian and big-endian sequences; less conventional endiannesses which could be described as being \"bi-endian\" or even \"$n$-endian\" can be formed by different or more elaborate connectives between such sequences; just worry about grouping of connectives.

This pair (existence/nonexistence) was chosen because there is nothing more fundemental and important to a thing than whether or not it exists.
