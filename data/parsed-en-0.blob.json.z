Note that this definition is in the passive voice in English. The 'step-parent'/'step-child' or even direct spousal or resultant 'in-law' relationships may in some sense be viewed as adoption via marriage. This definition is very broad, but a certain degree of integration is assumed or required (at least for certain purposes). Adoption can be by a community and the 'familial' relationship can be simply a somewhat interpersonally-distant communal one. Adoption need not be by an older or more senior person of a younger or more junior one. $x_4$ is most useful when it differs from $x_2$ (particularly if $x_2$ is an individual).

The blades need not close all the way nor do they need to be sharp or used for cutting(they could be used for grasping). Tongs typically are grasping-scissors, but tweezers are not. The emphasis is on how the blades move relative to one another and how they are connected to handles; the design is usually simple with only a few separate funtional parts. At least part of the blades should be to the side of the respective part of the other blade (so that these regions can move/slide relative to one another), even if the blades as a whole meet and cannot slide passed one another completely (such as with tongs). x1 is the whole object/tool, x2 are the parts which move relative to one another; in English, x1 could be called the \"(pair of) scissors\" whereas x2 could be called \"the scissor (blade)\".","scissor;shear;tong","a|9H8","(set/pair)","scissors/shears/clippers/(hedge)","trimmers/tongs","parts/blades","(scissor)","s|(blades,","x2)","necessarily)","s|pivot,","blades.","blades","cutting(they","grasping).","s|grasping-scissors,","handles","funtional","parts.","(so","regions","move/slide","s|another),","passed","tongs).","s|object/tool,","\"(pair","scissors\"","\"the","scissor","(blade)\".","shear","scissors/s'ears/clippers/('edge)","cutting(t'ey","'andles","s|anot'er),","\"t'e","s'ear","clippers","hedge","trimmers","pivot","grasping","'edge","a|9H8|74|i|j|9HD|q|9HE|9HF|13N|2y|9HG|EI|9HH|m|KJ|1v|8o|51|89B|1vu|5BG|gp|Mj|7H|9HI|9HJ|4z|3vG|2Iz|1t|m3|6FT|ZR|2n7|4G|9HK|1n3|XD|9HL|1E5|1y|8UC|1el|12M|4w|9HM|9HN|J2|55C|1nw|1Sh|1ei|LG|1E9|CM|1FK|Bq|9HO|qJ|9HP|oZ|lp|EQ|9HQ|67|oa|6gF|1Az|3Y|3AK|1js|3X3|8Ab|9HR|4lO|15X|hH|7Ms|3PK|9HS|9HT|1g|1ue|aG|jL|4y|8oO|1ef|gd|9HU|3kA|9HV|fH|9HW|9HX|uJ|CZ|2w|6R|8et|9HY|Th|3ol|9HZ|9Ha|89H|2t|5Ku|KA|9Hb|8qX|9Hc|2jp|9Hd|9He|9Hf|7No|c|9Hg|od|9Hh|37|5BI|5F|6FY|2K|5D|1EM|1FQ|9Hi|1BB|3Ac|3XB|9Hj|jX|1es|3kH|9Hk|3ou|5L5|2js|9Hl|9Hm|7J|6F|6Ks|6Kw|6Kp|9Hn|9Ho|9Hp|5K|5J|4H|9Hq|32s|9Hr|2P6|2M|JR|6Kv|9Hs|2PJ|JT","o|X|9H8|Z|9H9|9HA|8In|9HB|9HC|9Ht","$x_1$ is a non-binary-gendered and immature/young person of age $x_2$ immature by standard $x_3$","s|Word dispreferred in metaphor/example as sexist (use instead {verba}).

For example, $x_1$ could be some value with dimensions of currency/money/monetary value measured in real numbers, $x_2$ could be a specific business' profit from certain sales, $x_3$ may be time (so, $x_2$ would be the profit over time, measured in a real number of units of currency), and $x_4$ and $x_5$ would be specific times - such as today and yesterday, respectively. Ideally, all factors, variables, conditions, etc. other than $x_3$ should remain constant or there should be a control group/population which records the effects of changes in other factors, variables, conditions, etc.; however, in real life, things can be more complicated or messy and it is hard to ensure that all factors are accounted for (especially in social experiments and business); $x_5$ records those other conditions or specifies the scope (for example: subjects, time, and location) of the 'experiment'. Typically, $x_4$ will be temporally later than $x_5$, but this need not be the case; in any case, $x_4$ is taken to be the latter state (etc.) under consideration in the present analysis in the context of this word's usage (in some sequence). $x_1$ could be \"0\" (whatsoever that means) - it could even be identically so; in other words, there need be no change or mutual difference, even in principle (the function/object could be constant); and this fact could even be known a priori.

Body language, posturing, and stature are usually considered to be nonlocalized (body-general), although they need not be (and technically are not in general). Must be externally visible and/or internally sensed. Any non-body-part utensil/item (including clothing) must function as an extension of the body in the gesture. Need not be conscious or performed by a person (note that agent/performer is not mentioned in this definition); can, but need not, be accompanied by vocalizations (not necessarily linguistic), but the gesture itself is not primarily noise-producing. Might include sign language words or cheremes, although a more explicit word for linguistically organized and “full” cheremes is preferred (and especially for the sign language as a whole). x1 is possibly best typed by {nu} and/or {si'o}. x4 might be best expressed as an event; for example, it could be \"the event of the right hand touching the chest near the heart, with fist clenched\" for a salute, whereas/wherein x3 would be merely the fist/hand (and the chest near the heart). Use \"{cocygau}\" resp. \"{cocyzu'e}\" for: \"$x_1$ (agent resp. volitional entity) gestures; $x1$ agentively/actively makes gesture $x2$, communicating $x3$, performed with body part(s) $x4$ in motion $x5$\"; this lujvo uses an unofficial cmarafsi.

Traditionally, but not necessarily, $x_3$ is a strictly positive integer (in particular, $x_3$ is nonzero) and is called \"(the) modulus\"; if $x_3 = 1$, then $x_1$ and $x_2$ differ only by an integer amount - in other words, they have the same fractional part. Technically, $x_1$ and $x_2$ are symmetric under mutual exchange and can even be equivalent; however, in a manner morally analogous to \"{srana}\", $x_2$ is canonically/traditionally either the common residue (the unique element in the space which is congruent to $x_1$ mod $x_3$ and which is greater than or equal to 0 and strictly less than $x_3$) or the minimal residue (denoting the common residue by $c$, the minimal residue is either $c$ xor $c - x_3$, whichever is strictly less than the other in absolute value), and this may even be considered as its contextless default meaning (such as in \"lo se modju\").

This word is essentially identical with {dilcrmadjulu}; consider this word to be its gismu equivalent. It is not the modulus operator; for that, use {veldilcu}.
