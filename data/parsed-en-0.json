Caution must be used: matrix addition or scalar multiplication of matrices already have this distributional property, so this word is not needed in those cases; in fact, A+(fau'a)A would yield ((1+A, 2+A), (3+A, 4+A)), which is nonsensical (because, without \"fau'a\", the addition of a scalar entry to a matrix is undefined).","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"FAUhA","g":["distribution of function to entries","entrywise function application"]},{"w":"fa'u'ai","d":"non-logical connective: antirespectively; unmixed but reverse ordered distributed association.","n":"Works together with {fa'u}; given an ordering by {fa'u}, the terms connected by this word are (applied) in opposite order.","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"JOI","g":["and antirespectively","anti-respectively","antirespectively"]},{"w":"fau'ai","d":"Iteratively applies \"fau'a\" to each resultant operator until all operators resolve.","n":"Let matrix A = ((1, 2), (3, 4)); then A +(fau'ai) A = A +({fau'a}*) A = ((1 +(fau'a*) A, 2 +(fau'a*) A), (3 +(fau'a*) A, 4 +(fau'a*) A)) = (( ((1+1, 1+2), (1+3, 1+4)), ((2+1, 2+2),(2+3, 2+4)) ), ( ((3+1, 3+2), (3+3, 3+4)), ((4+1, 4+2), (4+3, 4+4)) )), which has all of the additions resolve (so the iteration terminates) - the result is a 2-by-2 matrix in which each entry is itself a 2-by-2 matrix.

If diphthong \"eu\" is ever accepted into Lojban, this definition would preferably be moved to \"{fi'eu}\" (because the \"eu\" would also be etymologically tied to \"Kettenbruch\", and the \"au\" diphthong is more basic and should be reserved for higher-priority words).","t":"experimental cmavo","g":["continued fraction","Kettenbruch"]},{"w":"fi'ei","d":"{ifle} modal, 1st place: if [sumti] (du'u or nu) is true...","n":"See {ifle}, {ganai}, {va'o}, {tefi'ei}","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"BAI","g":["if"]},{"w":"fi'i'e","d":"Welcome to","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"COI"},{"w":"fiakre","d":"$x_1$ is a fiacre, a small hackney carriage","n":"See {marce}","t":"obsolete fu'ivla","g":["fiacre"],"r":["fiakre"]},{"w":"fi'inai","d":"vocative: \n{fi'i} - hospitality\n{fi'inai} - inhospitality.","t":"cmavo-compound","s":"COI*","g":["inhospitality"]},{"w":"fi'o","d":"convert selbri to nonce modal/sumti tag.","t":"cmavo","s":"FIhO","g":["selbri to modal"]},{"w":"filsampu","d":"$s_1$=$f_1$ is simple/easy in property $s_2$ for $f_2$ under conditions $f_3$","n":"See also similar in meaning {frili}, {sampu}","t":"lujvo","g":["easy","simple"]},{"w":"filseljmi","d":"$f_{1}=sj_{1}$ (du'u) is an easy to understand/clear fact/truth to $f_{2}=sj_2$  about subject $sj_{3}$ under conditions $f_{4}$.","n":"Not jvajvo, but there exist essentially no useful jvajvo definitions for this lujvo.","t":"lujvo","g":["clear","elementary","understandable"]},{"w":"filselzga","d":"$x_1$ (event/object) is easily spotted, obvious to observer $x_2$ with senses $x_3$, under conditions $x_4$.","n":"A safer, healthier and lujvo-er alternative to {li'armi}.","t":"lujvo","g":["easily observed","obvious"]},{"w":"fingubni","d":"$x_1$ is free and open source (not limited to software)","n":"{finti}, {gubni}, {mencti}, {krali}, {finkrali}","t":"lujvo","g":["free cultural work","free software","open content","open source"]},{"w":"fintra","d":"$t_2$ is the style (in the sense of art/fashion/creative work/object) of object $f_2$ by creator $f_3$ derived from existing elements/ideas $f_4$","n":"From {finti} {tarti}","t":"lujvo","g":["style","style","style"]},{"w":"fi'ormerko","d":"$x_1$ pertains to African-American culture in aspect $x_2$.","t":"lujvo","g":["African-American"]},{"w":"fi'ortu'a","d":"$f_1$=$t_1$ is Africa.","n":"from {friko} {tumla}.

Making words in Lojban is difficult in a variety of ways, depending on what type of word you're trying to make. Proper {lujvo}-making requires a good grasp of the semantics of the relevant {gismu}; and of {tanru} syntax, especially the scope of various grammatical constructs; knowledge of Lojban morphology and phonotactics to correctly insert y-hyphens where needed and avoid unparseable wordlike forms such as *{tosmabru} and *{slinku'i} (see {valrtosmabru}, {valslinku'i}); and finally, if you want to add your word to the dictionary, facility with the lujvo-scoring algorithm. Making Type 4 {fu'ivla} (or {zi'evla}), on the other hand, presents the challenge of knowing, out of hundreds of wordlike phonological patterns, which will parse as  single-morpheme words and which will not. (For example, the nonce word {kadvati} will parse but *{kazvati} will not; {fra'aso} will but *{fra'asoi} will not; {kadnazbakai} will but {kadnazbackai} is a actually a lujvo.) Making Type 3 fu'ivla is comparatively easy, but still requires knowing how to use hyphen phonemes right and, of course, how to not violate phonotactical rules when lojbanizing foreign words.

If $m$ is defined, then its contextless default value is $m = 0$. This function/word first determines the base being used for interpretation of digit strings (determined by context or by explicit specification (JUhAU)) for/as applied to $x$; this determination takes place even before inputs are accepted after $x$; let this base be represented by $b$ throughout this description unless $b$ is explicitly specified as an input. In such case, if the base of $x$ is a positional system wherein each digit represents a corresponding multiple of a fixed natural number raised to the power of its position (as determined relative to the radix point) and wherein the overall number is the sum of these results/representands, or if $b$ is explicitly specified as an input, then $t$ is defined; if the base of $x$ is sufficiently bad or unclear and $b$ is not explicitly specified as an input, then $t$ is undefined. Of course, if $b$ is explicitly specified as an input, then that value (if valid) is the meaning of \"$b$\" throughout this description. If $t$ is undefined, then its slot is automatically and implicitly deleted from this word in that context (so the operator is at-most-3-ary and its input acceptance is terminated by the '$n$' xor '$m$' slot, whichever one is later yet defined (because, assumptively, '$b$' is not explicitly specified); if '$m$' is defined and explicitly uttered when '$t$' is undefined and the '$x$' and '$n$' values have been explicitly specified, then the third input is '$m$') and \"$b^t$\" $=$ \"$b^{(-t)}$\" $= b = 1$ formally for the purposes of this definition (but not necessarily for the base for any digit-to-number interpretation/conversion, particularly on $x$!). If $t$ is defined, then its contextless default value is $t = 0$. The rounding function, determined by $n$, is performed on $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$. If $n = 1$, then the rounding function is the ceiling function: $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the least integer that is greater than or equal to it; in other words, it rounds up. If $n = -1$, then the rounding function is the floor function: $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the greatest integer that is less than or equal to it; in other words, it rounds down. These integers are both determined by the ordering and metric. If $n = 0$, then the rounding function maps $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ to the integer that minimizes the metric distance between itself and $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ if a unique such integer exists (id est: $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the nearest integer, where \"nearest\"-ness is determined according to the order and metric); if no such unique integer exists, then $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the unique integer among these aforementioned options for which there exists an integer $Z$ such that $2Z+m$ is the integer in question; if no unique such integer exists, then the function is undefined. Thus, $n = 0$ produces the commonly used unbiased nearest-integer rounding function. In each of these cases, the output of the rounding function is then multiplied by sgn$(x) b^{t}$. Thus, it rounds at the $t$th digit if $b$ matches the base of $x$ and else to the nearest multiple of $b$ in the $t$th digit of abs$(x)$, so to speak. Notice that rounding up or down always is applied to the absolute value, so it is really rounding (positive or negative) infinity-ward or zeroward respectively. The order on, and the operators and metric endowing, the metric space and field of all real numbers is determined by context or by explicit specification. The absolute value function is denoted as \"abs( )\" in the definition, and the signum function sgn is such that sgn$(z) = z/$abs$(z)$ for all real $z:$ abs$(z) > 0$, and sgn$(0) = 0$.","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"VUhU","g":["ceiling function","floor function","nearest integer function","round down","rounding function","round to nearest integer","round up"]},{"w":"ji'i'u'u","d":"mekso, at-most-5-ary; rounding function.

In other words, where \"ji'i'u\" really rounds toward or away from $0$, this word rounds toward negative or positive infinity. The behaviors coincide for nonnegative $x$, but differ for $x < 0$; for example, for $x < 0$, a 'negative-type' rounding for \"ji'i'u\" would round toward $0$, which is actually an increase in value (just decrease in absolute value) while remaining negative, whereas a 'negative-type' rounding here would round toward negative infinity, which is a decrease in value (but an increase in absolute value) while remaining negative.

The construct as a whole syntactically functions as a parenthetical so that mekso may be resumed immediately thereafter without any difficulty. This word attaches to/affects the immediately preceding macrodigit string extending from the last evaluated number, number operation, etc. or bracket to/until this word. The preceding number is semantically interpreted according to the description to which the following sumti refers. If a sequence is supplied as the following sumti, the preceding number is interpreted so that each digit, starting from the left (default: see next), is understood as a multiple of the corresponding value in the sequence under the ordering given (which may produce an invalid/ill-formed result; the placement of {pi} matters as well).  If a single number is submitted (such as \"li {dau}\"), this word acts as {ju'u}; the number is interpreted according to the rules of mekso and is its own island for such interpretation (thus {ju'u} is needed to override a cultural/grammatical default interpretation, such as decimal, even if this is done within the mekso expression outside of and including the scope of this word). In this way, the sumti being (10^n)_n, which is a sequence, is the same as the sumti being just 10, but is very different from it being the sequence (10)_n.  The original default for numeral-position/string reading/interpretation is from left-to-right, where a digit on the left in a pair of digits represents that multiple of a \"later\" term in the sequence as compared to right member of the pair; thus \"23\" in decimal means (2*(10^1)) + (3*(10^0)), which is twenty-three.  This default may be overridden via specification of the sequence (either its ordering, its domain being negated, or alteration to the base); alternatively, and perhaps more easily, the appearance of \"la'e zoi jbo. ri'u bi'o zu'a .jbo\" will always reverse it (this is a special input value with interpretation defined by this grammar); when reversed, \"23\" in decimal means (2*(10^0)) + (3*(10^1)), which is to say thirty-two.  Generally, this word overrides the default interpretation of a string of microdigits when computing the value of a macrodigit (see: {ju'u'i}).

By default, the macrodigit is interpreted as being written/expressed in some cultural or grammatical default (this default is overridden by {ju'au} if its specifying sumti requires an alternative interpretation for the value of the macrodigits), probably decimal- the interpretation of the string of microdigits produces a number, x; the \"{pi'e}\" implies the denominator to be used in determining the fraction for which x is in the numerator and context or possibly a specified base determines its value- in timekeeping, the interpretation is typically x/60 for certain macrodigits. However, the default for determining the value of x given a string of microdigits might be useful to override (for example, Tsohnai uses an overall factorial base but each macrodigit is written in balanced quinary); this word specifies the base used for interpreting the macrodigit from a string of microdigits. It is placed at the end of the string (possibly before the next \"{pi'e}\") and its scope of effect extends from there, through the string of microdigits, to either the beginning of the number as a whole or the most recent \"{pi'e}\" (whichsoever was more recently uttered). It is to be followed by a sumti (or multiple sumti strung together by connectives) and has its scope of specification terminate with that sumti; in this regard, it works syntactically and semantically exactly like {ju'au}. In fact, {ju'au} can be used outside of the number in order to specify the macrodigit interpretation instead of this word (for example, if its sumti were la .tsonais., this word would not be needed); however, if only a sequence were to have been given as the argument of {ju'au} (such as the factorial sequence) and if some base other than decimal were desired for the interpretation of each macrodigit from the string of microdigits, then this word would be used. If only one macrodigit appears in the number, then this word is equivalent to {ju'au}. In short, the scope of this word is one contiguous string of microdigits, and it influences their interpretation into a macrodigit value in the same way that {ju'au} does. However, if both {ju'au} and this word specify how to interpret a given string of microdigits in the same number (composed of macrodigits), this word overrides the interpretation specified by {ju'au} (but only for this macrodigit); thus, for example, a Tsohnai number can have each of its macrodigits be interpreted in balanced quinary except one, which the speaker specifies via this word, because they know the value but did not want to convert it to balanced quinary (because it may be too large or hard to do so easily), so they instead expressed it in decimal.","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"JUhUhI","g":["long-digit interpretation specifier","macrodigit named base specifier"]},{"w":"ka'ai","d":"{kansa} modal, 1 place; with .../with a companion ...","n":"See also {kansa}","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"BAI","g":["with"]},{"w":"ka'au","d":"mekso unary operator: cardinality (#, | |)","n":"Usually should be reserved for use on sets; if applied to group, it is the cardinality of the underlying set (Which is the order of the group)- but it should probably not be applied to an element of a group.

Technically, $x_1$ (therefore, also $x_2$) and $x_3$ are mutually so, as well. However, $x_3$ will typically be used in order to identify the 'side of the family tree/genealogy' being considered and $x_2$ will typically be the focal point at which the several sides of family trees (including the considered one) intersect (being otherwise disjoint); as such, $x_2$'s paternal uncle will not be described as being $x_2$'s father's brother on $x_2$'s side of the tree. In other words, there is a large family tree with at least two 'sides' and they intersect at exactly one node; this node of intersection is canonically to typically be $x_2$ and $x_3$ is canonically to typically be used to designate which of these possible sides is being considered such that $x_1$ belongs to it. (Symmetry is enabled by the fact that the only inferrable family tree is the 'side' produced; the larger family tree is unknown, and so the collection of potential sides amongst which the specification is taken is also unknown). The largest family tree (graph union of all sides of the mentioned relatives) is the graph which the utterer and/or relatives mentioned consider to be the entirety of the family of all the relatives mentioned (plus some near relatives, so long as they belong to exactly one side); thus, it may include marriages, god-children, close friends, and exes, but it is unlikely to span over many generations. For example, maternal and paternal sides of families are considered to be separate sides of the family tree for a child, even if in the distant unknown past, that father and that mother share some sort of familial relationship (even including a biological common ancestor). This word can be used to hint at a path in the graph from $x_1$ to $x_2$, since there exists a path which connects them and which also includes $x_3$; therefore, it can be used to vaguely mean \"my onclic aunt-in-law by my Uncle John\" meaning that the referent is the utterer's Uncle John's wife's sister (or sister in law); use connectives in $x_3$ in order to include (if the connective means \"AND\") more nodes which must have paths (not necessarily the same ones) running through them from $x_1$ to $x_2$.
