This word emphasises movement or transportation, usually unidirectional for any given $x_1$ at any given time (not simultaneously bidirectional nor back-and-forth). It is meant to be a generic form of \"{nerkla}\" and \"{barkla}\", and is intended to approximate/analogize/extend their veljvo compositions. Aside from the aforementioned emphasis and intent, as well as the terbri, it is quite similar to \"{pagre}\" itself, although their might be further slight connotational differences (such as the means of passage through the barrier and the type of barrier involved, whether being able to remain on both sides of the barrier statically is within scope of definition (it might be for \"pagre\" but is not for this word, at least to any significant extent), etc.). $x_2$ is an exit or entrance when generic terminology is desired; a generic word for a portal or doorway (see: \"{vorme}\") technically is always equivalent, so long as the portal is open and functional, but we often conceptualize exits and entrances (whether unidirectional or bidirectional according to their designs) as being to or from the overall structure (such as a house or vehicle) and not merely internal to it (such as a bedroom or bathroom doorway in a house), and this word is intended to capture this implication more explicitly.","t":"lujvo","g":["enter or exit","exit or enter","pass through"]},{"w":"gricniselsa'a","d":"$s_2$ is the anthem of $g_1$.","n":"Cf. {girzu}, {cinmo}, {sanga}.","t":"lujvo","g":["anthem"]},{"w":"gripau","d":"$p_1$ is a subset of $g_1$.","n":"Mentioned in §18.7 (cll 1.1).","t":"lujvo","g":["subset"]},{"w":"gripi'i","d":"$x_1$ is the product (combined multiplication result) of $x_2$ (plurality of the same type as $x_1$)","n":"$x_2$ may be {jo'u}/{joi}/{ce'o}/{ce}.

For any tree-generating ordered relation S: if x S y, then x is a parent of y and y is a child of x; if x S y and y S z, then x is an ancestor of z and z is a descendant of x; \"x is a non-self parent of y\" means that x S y and $x \\neq y$, and likewise for the other relations just described when modified by the descriptor \"non-self\". A quipyew tree T is a directed tree graph generated by the reflexive closure of R, such that T is totally connected (in the symmetric closure of R), every node in the vertex set ($x_3$) of T has at most two non-self children and at most one non-self parent, and there exists exactly one special node $x_2$ (usually denoted \"0\") in the vertex set of T with the property that for any node n in the vertex set of T, n has two non-self children only if (but not necessarily if) n is a strict ancestor of $x_2$ according to the transitive closure of R.

When the argument of $x_4$ is 1, the generalized eigenspace $x_3$ is simply a strict/simple/basic eigenspace; this is the typical (and probable cultural default) meaning of this word. $x_4$ will typically be restricted to integer values k > 0. $x_2$ should always be specified (at least implicitly by context), for an eigenvalue does not mean much without the linear transformation being known. However, since one usually knows the said linear transformation, and since the basic underlying relationship of this word is \"eigen-ness\", the eigenvalue is given the primary terbri ($x_1$). When filling $x_3$ and/or $x_4$, $x_2$ and $x_1$ (in that order of importance) should already be (at least contextually implicitly) specified. $x_3$ is the set of all eigenvectors of linear transformation $x_2$, endowed with all of the typical operations of the vector space at hand. The default includes the zero vector (else the $x_3$ eigenspace is not actually a vector space); normally in the context of mathematics, the zero vector is not considered to be an eigenvector, but by this definition it is included. Thus, a Lojban mathematician would consider the zero vector to be an (automatic) eigenvector of the given (in fact, any) linear transformation (particularly ones represented by a square matrix in a given basis). This is the logically most basic definition, but is contrary to typical mathematical culture. This word implies neither nondegeneracy nor degeneracy of eigenspace $x_3$. In other words there may or may not be more than one linearly independent vector in the eigenspace $x_3$ for a given eigenvalue $x_1$ of linear transformation $x_2$. $x_3$ is the unique generalized eigenspace of $x_2$ for given values of $x_1$ and $x_4$. $x_1$ is not necessarily the unique eigenvalue of linear transformation $x_2$, nor is its multiplicity necessarily 1 for the same. Beware when converting the terbri structure of this word. In fact, the set of all eigenvalues for a given linear transformation $x_2$ will include scalar zero (0); therefore, any linear transformation with a nontrivial set of eigenvalues will have at least two eigenvalues that may fill in terbri $x_1$ of this word. The 'eigenvalue' of zero for a proper/nice linear transformation will produce an 'eigenspace' that is equivalent to the entire vector space at hand. If $x_3$ is specified by a set of vectors, the span of that set should fully yield the entire eigenspace of the linear transformation $x_2$ associated with eigenvalue $x_1$, however the set may be redundant (linearly dependent); the zero vector is automatically included in any vector space. A multidimensional eigenspace (that is to say a vector space of eigenvectors with dimension strictly greater than 1) for fixed eigenvalue and linear transformation (and generalization exponent) is degenerate by definition. The algebraic multiplicity $x_5$ of the eigenvalue does not entail degeneracy (of eigenspace) if greater than 1; it is the integer number of occurrences of a given eigenvalue $x_1$ in the multiset of eigenvalues (spectrum) of the given linear transformation/square matrix $x_2$. In other words, the characteristic polynomial can be factored into linear polynomial primes (with root $x_1$) which are exponentiated to the power $x_5$ (the multiplicity; notably, not $x_4$). For $x_4$ > $x_5$, the eigenspace is trivial. $x_2$ may not be diagonalizable. The scalar zero (0) is a naturally permissible argument of $x_1$ (unlike some cultural mathematical definitions in English). Eigenspaces retain the operations and properties endowing the vectorspaces to which they belong (as subspaces). Thus, an eigenspace is more than a set of objects: it is a set of vectors such that that set is endowed with vectorspace operators and properties. Thus {klesi} alone is insufficient. But the set underlying eigenspace $x_3$ is a type of {klesi}, with the property of being closed under linear transformation $x_2$ (up to scalar multiplication). The vector space and basis being used are not specified by this word. Use this word as a seltau in constructions such as \"eigenket\", \"eigenstate\", etc. (In such cases, {te} {aigne} is recommended for the typical English usages of such terms. Use {zei} in lujvo formed by these constructs. The term \"eigenvector\" may be rendered as {cmima} {be} {le} {te} {aigne}).
