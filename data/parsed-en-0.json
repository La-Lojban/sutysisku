The number of polytope 'tiles' used can be specified in the third of fifth terbri as desired; the polytopes used need not all be the same, nor regular, so long as the arrangement is meaningful and possible. One of the main differences between rectangular polyplets and polyominoes is that polyominoes cannot have their polytope tiles touching only at their vertices whereas polyplets can (thus, polyominoes are a subset of the rectangular polyplets); this difference can be specified in the final terbri. A tiling of a space may be considered to be an infinite polyform, but that is rather pathological and we can reasonably assume that polyforms referenced by this word will be finite. The polyform is considered to be a unified whole entity. The ambient space is usually going to be the Euclidean space of the same dimension as the polytopes (and the former dimension cannot be exceeded by the latter except in the marginal case of lower-dimensional (id est: hyperplanar) arrangements, in which case parallel cross-sections are really being considered); this space determines the rigid-motion/symmetry isomorphisms of various polyforms (Z and S tetraminoes are non-isomorphic under rigid-motion in the Euclidean plane but are so isomorphic in Euclidean 3-space). The ambient space also determines the expression of (and indeed the 'allowed') polytopes: spherical geometry allows for digons to be arranged so as to form a polyform, but Euclidean 2-space prohibits such objects from the set of possible polygons. The default polytope will probably be a 2-dimensional square; thus the default ambient space will likely be Euclidean 2-space.

Inside the module formed by the \"sei'au\" brackets, at most three sumti (where this counting contracts connected sumti into one) can be specified. The first one is a {mau'au}-{zai'ai} quoted function (which is taken to be the operand of this word); it must be preceded (not necessarily immediately) by {li}; let f be this function. The second and third sumti each are a nonnegative integer (preceded by {li}); call them $n$ and $m$ respectively; $n$ defaults to 1 and $m$ defaults to the next (thus-far unfilled) terbri number for/of the current selbri unless these specifications are overridden by zmico; if the relevant selbri has no terbri following this word, then this default value of $m$ causes this word to have no effect. The $m$th terbri of the selbri to which this construct applies will be passed through f before being filled by any sumti (including {zo'e}, explicit or implicit; terbri numbers start counting at 1 and increase by 1 with each new occurrence) for the next $n$ occurrences of the aforementioned selbri in the discourse (with $n$ = 1 counting the current occurrence; aside: a non-default value of $m$ can thus affect the interpretation of an already-filled terbri of the currently open selbri in an afterthought manner); this counting is only done forward in the discourse/time, including the current selbri, never back through it. Thus, $n$ = 0 effectively neutralizes this word, $n$ being infinite causes the effect to be permanent. f being {zi'a'o} returns the terbri in question to its default value/understanding (according to zmico). It is important to realize that this word does not affect the $m$th terbri of all selbri, just of the one currently open when this word is utterred (no matter where it is positioned/nested in future costructs). If this word is in conflict with another usage of this word over the same terbri, follow the specification applied by the most recent still active occurrence of this construct; this construct is considered to be active for this purpose until its-$n$ occurrences of the appropriate terbri are uttered; thus if the earlier-$n$ is greater than the later-$n$, the later effect takes precedent until it is disactivated, after which point the earlier effect resumes. Define $n$ and  $m$ (and f) outside of the module created by brackets of this word if you wish to reuse them; for the sake of future referencing the value specified within the module, $n$ gets reduced/decremented by 1 at each occurrence of the appropriate terbri until it reaches the value 0 (at which value it remains forever after); if $n$ is a series of connected numbers, this decrementation is applied to each connectand in turn. Use {pi'u} (possibly subscripted) in order to simplify utterances. Especially helpful if f is non-injective. The affected terbri must be referenced by {ce'u} as an operand of f wheresoever it is desired; this reference must be explicit.  Let 'broda' be the currentry open selbri; then this word replaces $broda_m$ with f($broda_m$) in the definition of 'broda' for the next $n$ occurrences of the terbri. For example, if f were {cu'a}, then any sumti which fills $broda_m$ will be understood to be doing so in absolute value.

This is used with {ni'u} (resp. {ma'u}) in order to explicitly specify a finite and nonpositive (resp. nonnegative) number (if it is real); on their own, {ni'u} or {ma'u} can refer to infinities as well. {xo'ei} can refer to this meaning, but it is equipped with additional restrictions, since {xo'e} and {xo'ei} know their context; {xo'e} is a bit more general in that it can refer to infinite numbers too.","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"PA","g":["finite digit"]},{"w":"si'i'ei","d":"story time toggle.","n":"\"Story time interpretation\" is as is described in CLL v1.1 Chapter 10 Section 14 ( http://lojban.org/publications/cll/cll_v1.1_xhtml-section-chunks/section-story-time.html ).

It is not implied that $x_{(n+1)}$ is the minimal proper superset of $x_n$ for any integer $n>1$ (even if they are indeed a proper-superset/proper-subset pair); for example, $x_2$ may be a street number, $x_2$ may be a city, and $x_3$ may be a state, even though wards may subdivide cities (but contain street subsegments) and counties may subdivide states (and contain cities). Each subsequent sumti contains or possesses the previous one(s), except the first, as a node or location (or subunit) and is only slightly larger/broader than it/them. There is no fixed meaning to any given slot; they just collectively possess this 'zooming-out' property. For example: In \"Cupboard under the stairs, 4, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey, England, UK, northern hemisphere, Earth\", each term separated by commas would be its own separate sumti (and we could continue to widen the scope beyond Earth); note that \"4\" is a name and identifies a house. Postal codes or ZIP codes should be used with caution in this word - they must be inserted in the correct spot; for example, (in the U.S.) a standard ZIP code identifies (approximately) the administering post office or municipal region and, therefore, must come after a street name but usually before the city name; ZIP+4 usually identifies a subdivision of the city or service area for the local post office, so it would come after the street name but before the city name and the standard ZIP code; ZIP+4+2 is usually enough to identify a building, so it would precede the street name (but may follow the apartment number in some cases); going the other way: the first few digits identify the region of the country or type of high-level administrative subunit of the U.S. and would come somewhere after the state name or similar. Containment is not assumed to be proper, so consecutive sumti may be equivalent (for example ZIP+4+2 can be equivalent to the house/building identifier and street address, but may be strictly contain the apartment identifier). Delete $x_1$ in order to talk of things like \"Chesterfield, New Hampshire\" (tcaudu$_2$ = Chesterfield, tcaudu$_3$ = New Hampshire); in this case, since the terbri structure of this word (after tcaudu$_1$) is constant/symmetric wrt shift in sumti slot (indexing), it may be cleanest and most elegant to begin the bridi with the selbri. Any number of consecutive unfilled sumti slots (after tcaudu$_1$) is technically equivalent but may be used informally in order to show that the utterer has a well-defined or standard sequence of nested classes which subdivide the subsequent sumti and which contain the previous ones. Deleting any finite number of sumti slots after the first has no nontrivial effect. This word might be generalizable to other nested structures or graphs such as information in a file (example: cell coordinates, tab name, Excel file name, directory to which the file directly belongs, next superdirectory thereof, ..., stem directory) or members in a family tree (example: full name of person, branch of family, larger family name, ..., all of humanity, ..., all of Earth life).

This happens on structure c, which defines what various values and limits mean. b is the 'order' of the result of this convergence (so that it is the bth-order integral (equivalently, -bth-order derivative) of the Heaviside step/Theta function with respect to a so that b = -1 yields the Dirac delta 'function' centered/with interesting point at 0, b = 0 yields the Heaviside step/Theta function with respect to a centered at/with interesting point 0, etc.).  Natural numbers (or 0) for b yield a 'special' polynomial (let us call it p) of that order in indeterminant a for all values of a greater than 0 and 0 for all values of a less than 0 so that p(a) = a^b Theta(a). Input e is for when the particular functions in d are of interest and only e of them have been computed (so that, for finite e, the output is not exactly the bth order Heaviside function); in other words, the limit of the family indices is being taken to e; this is of particular importance for negative values of b: |b| > 1, since they will not be identically 0 in some sense (else, all information is lost about the special structure/nature of this function). The contextless defaults are: b = 0, c is the field of real numbers (with absolute value norm and ordering due to signed absolute value), d is bth-order integral of ((1 + y + z * erf(k a / (2^(1/2)) ) ) / 2)-like functions that are properly normalized and are of proper height, e is infinity (countable).

Then $D(e^x)=0$ at best, strictly speaking, because $x$ must be just a number and so the differentiand is a constant (in fact and at worst, it may not even be a function, in which case the derivative is not even defined); we accept this notation to mean something else (which will be shown momentarily) because few other notations are convenient. However, what we really mean, and what this word facilitates, is: $D(exp)=exp$; this is true because the differentiand is a differentiable (and special) function. This word is related to {te'a} in a fashion analgpus to the ordered relation between {fa'i} (resp. {va'a}) and {fi'u} (resp. {vu'u}). The domain and codomain sets are purposefully vague.","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"VUhU","g":["exp","natural exponentiation function"]},{"w":"te'oi","d":"$x_1$ (set of points in time) is a time of [bridi] taking place.","n":"The inner bridi is realis.

This word can be used to specify the concept of \"$n$th cousin $m$-times removed\"-ness; $x_1$ and $x_2$ would be the cousins, $x_3-1 = n$, and $x_4$ is closely related to $m$ but is signed. If one views the tree graphs to which $x_1$ and $x_2$ belong with the viewing perspective such that siblings and spouses are mutually separated horizontally and such that ancestors are separated from their descendants vertically (with ancestors in the positive direction relative to their descendants), then $x_3$ is the unsigned horizontal distance between $x_1$ and $x_2$. Additionally, $x_4$ is, approximately, the signed generational offset/difference between subjects $x_1$ and $x_2$; it is their signed 'vertical' difference under the aforementioned viewing perspective and sign convention. The relationship need not actually be cousinhood  (as perceived by English); direct ancestor-descendant pairs, (aunt/uncle)-(niece/nephew) pairs, and in fact any pair of family members with a well-specified most recent common ancestor (that is known) have this relationship to one another. This word can be used for specifying the number of \"great\"'s in the title of a relationship between $x_1$ and $x_2$ (with some calculational forethought). The tree diagram can be more generic than a family tree though; thus cousinhood is just a way to put it into context/application and is not really essential to the meaning except through analogy. Notice the ordering of all terms; if the graph is directed, the arguments of the distance matters. The graph should probably be a tree locally if it is to be a well-defined relationship. $x_3$ is unchanged but $x_4$ is negated (multiplied by $-1$) by/under exchange of $x_1$ and $x_2$. The ordered pair $(x_3, x_4)$ is named \"consanguistance between $x_1$ and $x_2$ (in that order)\" by Curtis Franks. For a normal family tree and fixed $x_1$ therein, consanguistance produces countably many equivalence classes of nodes. It does not recognize the difference between half or full relatives, marriages/parentings are either unsupported (when $x_3 > 0$) or are reduced to be equivalent (when $x_3 = 0$ and $x_4 \\neq 0$), and gender/sex are ignored/reduced to equivalence. The set of nodes $x_2$ with $x_3 = 0$ is called $x_1$'s (the subject's) genealogical line (id est: if $x_3 = 0$, then $x_1$ re'au'e ja se dzena $x_2$ according to the edge relation on the graph or $x_1 = x_2$); the set of nodes with $x_3 > 0$ are sibling/branch/side lines, which could be labelled and ordered, but doing so would be somewhat difficult with this word. This word focuses on the relationship between $x_1$ and $x_2$, not the relationship between each of them and A; for that, see \".{anseingu}\". The underlying tree graph is, modulo an equivalence relation involving tseingu, a 'quipyew' tree graph (see \"{grafnkipliiu}\"). This concept is fairly unnatural and convoluted, so it is probably {malgli} except for the purpose of translations; in a natural, culturally-neutral Lojbanic context, \".anseingu\" is preferred.","t":"fu'ivla","g":["consanguinity values","consanguistance","cousin degree","cousin order","cousin removal","degree of removal","kinship number"],"r":["tseingu"]},{"w":"tsekane","d":"$x_1$ (linear manifold, vector, etc.) is/lies secant to $x_2$ (object, surface, curve, manifold, etc.) passing through or toward points/loci $x_3$ (set of intersected points), by standard/definition/in system $x_4$.","n":"No necessary implication of co-directionality.

The entry for this cmavo compound is essentially a proposal to redefine the {va'i} spectrum slightly, to make it a little more like the similar discursive {ta'u}. Consider the English sentences: (A) \"Gold has atomic number 79, in other words, there are 79 protons in a gold nucleus.\" (B) \"There are 79 protons in a gold nucleus, in other words, gold has atomic number 79.\" In English, in both A and B, the parts are discursively connected by the same \"in other words\" connective, even though the connection is in two mutually opposite directions. To understand that there really is a difference between the two, consider another pair of sentences: (A') \"According to the Bible, God made the world in six days, in other words, it took almost a week to make everything around us.\" (B') \"According to the Bible, it took almost a week to make everything around us, in other words, God made the world in six days.\" Unlike A and B, from among the pair A' and B', only A' makes sense, B' sounds absurd. The proposal is to redefine Lojban's {va'i} and {va'i} {nai}, in the motivation to give {va'i} {nai} more of a use, to reflect this very Lojbanic difference in direction, which English cannot capture. This compound, i.e. \"va'i cu'i\" would then acquire the meaning of \"in the same words\". There is no set in stone rule for which of {va'i} and {va'i} {nai} stands for which direction for any given two pair of sentences: however, if one of them is used to connect them in one way, then the other one would connect them in the reverse order. \"broda .i va'i nai brode\" simply is defined as equivalent to \"brode .i va'i broda\".

If a language lacks a minimal pair which distinguishes paired phonés, then any strings which nominally differ in only such pairs will belong to $x_2$ of this word in that language; in other words allophonic but not phonemic differences produce such similarities. But even with minimal pairs, some words may not be distinguishable. This word refers to indistinguishability in the form of a word as well as its meaning/usage; so, homophones are not necessarily similar in this sense, nor are synonyms. The combination of both qualities does produce such similarities in spoken English (not necessarily written English, since the orthography is not phonemic). In English, phonation duration and, in some cases, certain phonation qualities (such as tonation, voicing, nasalation, place of articulation, aspiration, etc. (again: only in some cases)) do not distinguish words. Dialectal differences usually produce such similarities too (a U.S. English speaker and a UK English speaker will say the word \"car\" differently but will agree about everything concerning it, including its rhyming qualities in their dialects, its meaning, and its spelling). In Lojban, phonation duration (such as \".{yyy} \" versus merely \".{y} \"; but notice that some transcriptions are interpreted as producing multiphthongs/glides/syllabification, so \".{iii} \" is distinct from mere \".{i} \") and minor differences in place of articulation (trilled \"r\" versus English \"r\", for example) and sometimes voicing (for nasals, rhotics, laterals, and presently xy) do not produce word distinctions; so, they will generate such similarities in Lojban.

In decimal, $10^{(1/2)} = \\sqrt{(10)} = 3.16227766\\dots$ (also expressed/represented in decimal). In different bases, this value may change; for example, in hexadecimal, it might be exactly four ($4$); however, this is an outstanding as-of-yet unsolidified area in the Lojban grammar/semantics (do \"{ki'o}\" and Metric prefixes change according to the base?). This number is nice, as it is close to both 3 and and the circle constant pi ($\\pi$) in decimal usage; these three values arise fairly frequently and a great trick in decimal Fermi estimation is to use their approximate identity in order to simplify expressions. Now, when the quantity is dimensionful (has units), if the mantissa approximates this value, then one can instead express the mantissa as approximately 1 and the unit as being augmented by this prefix. This word is also good for short-hand/quick expressions. This word has no English equivalent and is not part of the official set of SI prefixes, but it does generalize them. \"{xaudbo}\" = \"{kamre} {li} {dau} {te'a} {fi'u} {re}\" in decimal (if it generalizes for other bases, change \"dau\" into the base; in other words, \"dau\" generally becomes \"pano\" in such case, where the base is given by context). While this suggestion is not perfectly compatible with SI (which allows only one prefix at a time), the negative-power version of this (\"kamre li dau te'a {ni'u} fi'u re\", where \"dau\" has the aforementioned caveats; $1*10^{-(1/2)}$) can just be expressed as a lujvo/rafsi/tanru containing both \"{decti}\" and this word (as veljvo/selrafsi/{seljavytertau}), because $A^{(-1/2)} = \\sqrt{(1/A)} = A^{(+1/2)} / A$, and $A$ (ten in at least decimal) is the base.
