If a language lacks a minimal pair which distinguishes paired phonés, then any strings which nominally differ in only such pairs will belong to $x_2$ of this word in that language; in other words allophonic but not phonemic differences produce such similarities. But even with minimal pairs, some words may not be distinguishable. This word refers to indistinguishability in the form of a word as well as its meaning/usage; so, homophones are not necessarily similar in this sense, nor are synonyms. The combination of both qualities does produce such similarities in spoken English (not necessarily written English, since the orthography is not phonemic). In English, phonation duration and, in some cases, certain phonation qualities (such as tonation, voicing, nasalation, place of articulation, aspiration, etc. (again: only in some cases)) do not distinguish words. Dialectal differences usually produce such similarities too (a U.S. English speaker and a UK English speaker will say the word \"car\" differently but will agree about everything concerning it, including its rhyming qualities in their dialects, its meaning, and its spelling). In Lojban, phonation duration (such as \".{yyy} \" versus merely \".{y} \"; but notice that some transcriptions are interpreted as producing multiphthongs/glides/syllabification, so \".{iii} \" is distinct from mere \".{i} \") and minor differences in place of articulation (trilled \"r\" versus English \"r\", for example) and sometimes voicing (for nasals, rhotics, laterals, and presently xy) do not produce word distinctions; so, they will generate such similarities in Lojban. Additionally any pair of words which come into {gimkamsmikezypro} (or similar for {zi'evla}) in Lojban have such a similarity in Lojban.","word similarity","a|7Qp","o|4Z0|7Qm|7Qn|7Qo|2mf|7Qq","vlagri","$g_1$ is a verse/stanza with property (ka) $g_2$ meaning $v_2$ in language $v_3$.","s|Cf. {valsi}, {girzu}, {vlali'i}, {jufmei}, {pempau}.","a|77I","o|4Z0|7Qs|7Qt|7Qu|2mf|7Qv","zerxa'u","$x_1$ illegally/unlawfully lives in/occupies location $x_2$ (usually a building); $x_1$ squats $x_2$.","From {zekri} {xabju}.","squat","a|7R0","o|4Z0|7Qx|7Qy|7Qz|2mf|7R1","vlagenkle","s|= {pevyselma'o}; Generalization of {selma'o}, to be usable for non-cmavo and words from other languages.
