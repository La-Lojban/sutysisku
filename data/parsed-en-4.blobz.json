No implication about nontriviality (id est: possibly includes diameters/radii or tangents). Prone to mathematical/geometric generalization. It can be used metaphorically as in English (\"secantial\") for a line of discussion ($x_1$) which relates to or touches the general topic or discussion ($x_2$) in a non-distant manner or in several ways or at multiple points (more intimately than \"tangential\" implies, but still as sidetrack/a bit off-topic), the latter acting as the primary/main/current/relevant/focal topic or discussion, due to or at a connecting points/details/particular subtopics/ideas ($x_3$), with $x_1$ being a somewhat relevant or interesting branching line of thought other than the main one; in this case, it is understood in sensu stricto (nontrivially/strictly/properly/{praperi} secant).

This word can be used to specify the concept of \"$n$th cousin $m$-times removed\"-ness; $x_1$ and $x_2$ would be the cousins, $x_3-1 = n$, and $x_4$ is closely related to $m$ but is signed. If one views the tree graphs to which $x_1$ and $x_2$ belong with the viewing perspective such that siblings and spouses are mutually separated horizontally and such that ancestors are separated from their descendants vertically (with ancestors in the positive direction relative to their descendants), then $x_3$ is the unsigned horizontal distance between $x_1$ and $x_2$. Additionally, $x_4$ is, approximately, the signed generational offset/difference between subjects $x_1$ and $x_2$; it is their signed 'vertical' difference under the aforementioned viewing perspective and sign convention. The relationship need not actually be cousinhood  (as perceived by English); direct ancestor-descendant pairs, (aunt/uncle)-(niece/nephew) pairs, and in fact any pair of family members with a well-specified most recent common ancestor (that is known) have this relationship to one another. This word can be used for specifying the number of \"great\"'s in the title of a relationship between $x_1$ and $x_2$ (with some calculational forethought). The tree diagram can be more generic than a family tree though; thus cousinhood is just a way to put it into context/application and is not really essential to the meaning except through analogy. Notice the ordering of all terms; if the graph is directed, the arguments of the distance matters. The graph should probably be a tree locally if it is to be a well-defined relationship. $x_3$ is unchanged but $x_4$ is negated (multiplied by $-1$) by/under exchange of $x_1$ and $x_2$. The ordered pair $(x_3, x_4)$ is named \"consanguistance between $x_1$ and $x_2$ (in that order)\" by Curtis Franks. For a normal family tree and fixed $x_1$ therein, consanguistance produces countably many equivalence classes of nodes. It does not recognize the difference between half or full relatives, marriages/parentings are either unsupported (when $x_3 > 0$) or are reduced to be equivalent (when $x_3 = 0$ and $x_4 \\neq 0$), and gender/sex are ignored/reduced to equivalence. The set of nodes $x_2$ with $x_3 = 0$ is called $x_1$'s (the subject's) genealogical line (id est: if $x_3 = 0$, then $x_1$ re'au'e ja se dzena $x_2$ according to the edge relation on the graph or $x_1 = x_2$); the set of nodes with $x_3 > 0$ are sibling/branch/side lines, which could be labelled and ordered, but doing so would be somewhat difficult with this word. This word focuses on the relationship between $x_1$ and $x_2$, not the relationship between each of them and A; for that, see \".{anseingu}\". The underlying tree graph is, modulo an equivalence relation involving tseingu, a 'quipyew' tree graph (see \"{grafnkipliiu}\"). This concept is fairly unnatural and convoluted, so it is probably {malgli} except for the purpose of translations; in a natural, culturally-neutral Lojbanic context, \".anseingu\" is preferred.","consanguinity values","consanguistance","cousin degree","cousin order","cousin removal","degree of removal","kinship number","a|6u|6v|6w|6x|6y|6z|70","a|6r","o|V|6r|6s|6t|Z|71|72","banje'udu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''yud'' (Judeo-Tripolitanian Arabic).","Arabic","a|76","a|74","o|V|74|75|Y|Z|77|78","banje'ucu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''yuc'' (Yuchi).","Yuchi","a|7C","a|7A","o|V|7A|7B|Y|Z|7D|7E","banje'ubu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''yub'' (Yugambal).","Yugambal","a|7I","a|7G","o|V|7G|7H|Y|Z|7J|7K","tse'ete","$x_1$ is (a depiction of) a Set animal/Typhonian beast/sha.","Set animal","sha","Typhonian beast","a|7O|7P|7Q","a|7M","o|r|7M|7N|Z|7R|7S","bancusulu","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''csl'' (Chinese Sign Language).","Chinese Sign Language","a|7W","a|7U","o|V|7U|7V|Y|Z|7X|7Y","banje'u'a","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''yua'' (Yucateco).","Yucateco","a|7c","a|7a","o|V|7a|7b|Y|Z|7d|7e","banjetuve","$x_1$ is the language with ISO 639-3 code ''ytw'' (Yout Wam).","Yout Wam","a|7i","a|7g","o|V|7g|7h|Y|Z|7j|7k","tsazezusu","$x_1$ is a gym / a place for working out $x_2$ (ka)","X2 is a property enabled by going to X1.","gym","a|7p","a|7m","o|V|7m|7n|7o|Z|7q|7r","tsazezu","$x_1$ performs workout/exercise/training $x_2$ (ka) using equipment/accessories $x_3$.","s|{jbofuvi} formed from the lujvo {tsazenzu'e} ({tsali} {zenba} {zukte}) but with a bespoke place structure to make it useful for discussing working out.

This word allows for easy vagueness about which extremal bound is to be used.

For the purposes of $x_5$, whatsoever is submitted to $x_1$ becomes a member of a singleton set and $x_5 = 1$ means that this whole member is drawn as the referent of the clause in the definition which begins with \"moreover\"; however, for the purposes of $x_5$, the argument of $x_4$, which inherently must be set or similar, is left bare - meaning that at least one of its members, rather than the set as whole (being treated as a member of a singleton), is the referent of the clause in the definition which begins with \"moreover\"; in fact, if $x_5 = 2$, then the set from which the referent is being drawn is actually the relative complement of Singleton($x_1$) in $x_4$ (see: \"{kleivmu}\"). So, if $x_1$ is a set or a complicated sumti string composed via connectives, then $x_5 = 1$ constructs a singleton set containing $x_1$ and then the referent drawn is, necessarily, $x_1$; meanwhile, if $x_5 = 2$, then some member of $x_4$ itself, excluding $x_1$ (whatsoever it may be), is the referent which is drawn; for the purposes of $x_5$, $x_1$ and $x_4$ are treated asymmetrically, for the sake of utility and minimal complication. An analog of many of the notes in \"{zmaduje}\" will apply here (but recall that $x_3$ may be either \"{ka} {zmadu}\" or \"ka {mleca}\"!). If negated, then it means \"either $x_1$ is not the most extreme (in said property amongst said set) at the $x_3$ end of the scale, or the $((x_5)^{2})$th argument does not attain the said property (by the said standard)\", where $x_5$ works as previously described, the \"or\" is inclusive, and both of the \"not\"s are the ones specified by the negation (such as \"{na}\", \"{na'e}\", \"{to'e}\", etc.);

It is not implied that $x_{(n+1)}$ is the minimal proper superset of $x_n$ for any integer $n>1$ (even if they are indeed a proper-superset/proper-subset pair); for example, $x_2$ may be a street number, $x_2$ may be a city, and $x_3$ may be a state, even though wards may subdivide cities (but contain street subsegments) and counties may subdivide states (and contain cities). Each subsequent sumti contains or possesses the previous one(s), except the first, as a node or location (or subunit) and is only slightly larger/broader than it/them. There is no fixed meaning to any given slot; they just collectively possess this 'zooming-out' property. For example: In \"Cupboard under the stairs, 4, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey, England, UK, northern hemisphere, Earth\", each term separated by commas would be its own separate sumti (and we could continue to widen the scope beyond Earth); note that \"4\" is a name and identifies a house. Postal codes or ZIP codes should be used with caution in this word - they must be inserted in the correct spot; for example, (in the U.S.) a standard ZIP code identifies (approximately) the administering post office or municipal region and, therefore, must come after a street name but usually before the city name; ZIP+4 usually identifies a subdivision of the city or service area for the local post office, so it would come after the street name but before the city name and the standard ZIP code; ZIP+4+2 is usually enough to identify a building, so it would precede the street name (but may follow the apartment number in some cases); going the other way: the first few digits identify the region of the country or type of high-level administrative subunit of the U.S. and would come somewhere after the state name or similar. Containment is not assumed to be proper, so consecutive sumti may be equivalent (for example ZIP+4+2 can be equivalent to the house/building identifier and street address, but may be strictly contain the apartment identifier). Delete $x_1$ in order to talk of things like \"Chesterfield, New Hampshire\" (tcaudu$_2$ = Chesterfield, tcaudu$_3$ = New Hampshire); in this case, since the terbri structure of this word (after tcaudu$_1$) is constant/symmetric wrt shift in sumti slot (indexing), it may be cleanest and most elegant to begin the bridi with the selbri. Any number of consecutive unfilled sumti slots (after tcaudu$_1$) is technically equivalent but may be used informally in order to show that the utterer has a well-defined or standard sequence of nested classes which subdivide the subsequent sumti and which contain the previous ones. Deleting any finite number of sumti slots after the first has no nontrivial effect. This word might be generalizable to other nested structures or graphs such as information in a file (example: cell coordinates, tab name, Excel file name, directory to which the file directly belongs, next superdirectory thereof, ..., stem directory) or members in a family tree (example: full name of person, branch of family, larger family name, ..., all of humanity, ..., all of Earth life).

Alternatively, she was sometimes identified as the virgin goddess Iustitia or Astraea, holding the scales of justice in her hand as the constellation Libra. Since ferti in lojban covers both potential and actual/realized fertility, the original meaning of the constellation have been chosen, but you could probably still interpret the name in both senses (as a deity of fecundity or as a fertile virgin).","Virgo","a|45p","o|3qm|45m|45n|45o|3qO|45q","uikis","s|Wiki, WikiWikiWeb.","Wiki","WikiWikiWeb","a|45u|45v","o|3qh|45s|45t|3qO|45w","uindos","Windows","s|name of an operating system, or the familiy of operating systems","a|45z","o|3qm|45y|45z|460|3qO|461","ramadan","Ramadan","Cf. {ramdana}.","Ramazan","a|464|466","o|3qm|463|464|465|3qO|467","ralj","Chief","a|46A","o|3qh|469|46A|3qO|46B","pyd","Tibet.","Tibet","a|46F","o|3qh|46D|46E|3qO|46G","uniks","Unix","s|A family of operating systems.

It can pack such detail into short words and syllables due to its large phonemic inventory, use of phonemic tone and stress, and complex agglutinative morphology.

If this word is followed by a number of/evaluated to a value 0 or 1 (preceded immediately by \"li\"), this value is taken to be an explicit reset of the mode to the value indicated (the value in question is called a seed value). Iff the seed value is 1, the mode is set thereinafter to multiplicative style; iff the seed value is 0, the mode is set thereinafter to additive style. (That is: the seed values represent the identity elements under the operation which the mode emulates.).  No other value, numerical or otherwise (including other sumti or even Boolean values, which actually mean \"truth\" and \"false\", rather than \"1\" and \"0\" respectively, despite common representations), may act as a seed value of this word.  Thus, only in the context of this word being followed by a \"li\"-introduced mekso expression X which evaluates to the numbers 0 or 1 wherein X is not intended to be taken as a seed value of this word must this word be followed by {ku} prior to X; in this case there is no explicit seed value. If this word has no explicit seed value, then this word causes the mode of interpretation of double-negatives to switch between multiplicative style and additive style; an utterance of this word switches the mode to whichever of these two options was not being used immediately previously.  Thus, it is its own terminator/negator.  Lojban default (without context) is in multiplicative mode: \"mi na na nelci\" is nearly equivalent to \"mi nelci\"; double-negatives cancel leaving a positive sense (even if it is not entirely/definitively affirmative). So, one utterance of this word (under standard conventions) in a given discourse will change double-negatives to become additive. This mode is similar to (some) Spanish negation or AAVE negation; multiple negatives compound/add together, intensifying the negativity (subjective truth-value) of an utterance.  In additive mode, \"[zau'e'u] mi na na nelci\" is equivalent to \"mi ba'e na nelci\" or something of the like; \"[zau'e'u] mi na na na na nelci\" would be simply further emphasized (roughly twice as emphatic as the previous example's negation).  This word is intended mostly for stylistic purposes and translations, as well as enabling further cultural neutrality. lai .krtisfranks. requests that this word (and all of its relevant information, including the selma'o label) be mapped to \"{zau'eu}\" if the string \"eu\" ever becomes officially accepted in Lojban.","ZAUhEhU","additive negation indicator","affirmation toggle","double-negative toggle","multiplicative negation indicator","negation mode toggle","a|4RB|4RC|4RD|4RE|4RF","o|4O7|4R7|4R8|4R9|4OB|4RA|4RG","ci'i'e","transfnite cardinal beth","See also: {ci'i}.","transfnite cardinal","a|4RL","o|4O7|4RI|4RJ|4RK|4OB|4OK|4RM","zau'e","vocative: go! / come on! / get on it! / let's!","s|A call to act now.

When it is well-defined (and the inputs, excluding $m$ are fixed by context), denote $z_{m} = -i * ext((A,<),i,n)|_{m}$.

This happens on structure c, which defines what various values and limits mean. b is the 'order' of the result of this convergence (so that it is the bth-order integral (equivalently, -bth-order derivative) of the Heaviside step/Theta function with respect to a so that b = -1 yields the Dirac delta 'function' centered/with interesting point at 0, b = 0 yields the Heaviside step/Theta function with respect to a centered at/with interesting point 0, etc.).  Natural numbers (or 0) for b yield a 'special' polynomial (let us call it p) of that order in indeterminant a for all values of a greater than 0 and 0 for all values of a less than 0 so that p(a) = a^b Theta(a). Input e is for when the particular functions in d are of interest and only e of them have been computed (so that, for finite e, the output is not exactly the bth order Heaviside function); in other words, the limit of the family indices is being taken to e; this is of particular importance for negative values of b: |b| > 1, since they will not be identically 0 in some sense (else, all information is lost about the special structure/nature of this function). The contextless defaults are: b = 0, c is the field of real numbers (with absolute value norm and ordering due to signed absolute value), d is bth-order integral of ((1 + y + z * erf(k a / (2^(1/2)) ) ) / 2)-like functions that are properly normalized and are of proper height, e is infinity (countable). Heaviside(0,0,...,f_0) = 1/2 = f_0 is typical and is a contextless default for b = 0 (however, it may in particular be set to 0 or 1 so that the function is left-/right-continuous at a = 0; for values of b other than 0, f_b = 0 is the contextless default; note that f_(-1) must be infinity 'of the proper magnitude' (it cannot be specified to be otherwise).

Given the other sumti in the predicate (filling the corresponding terbri), the underlying relation (selbri) is claimed to be invalid in this circumstance. Examples: \"non-integrable\", \"non-measurable\" (confer: \".{umre}\"), \"non-summable\" (say, of strings), \"the limit does not exist\". This avoids the necessity of creating a pair of words for every such mathematical concept (one for when the operation may be applied to the inputs so as to yield a well-defined value which may be specified and one for when such is not the case). Other uses may develop or be found. This word does not 'delete' the terbri (unlike \"{zi'o}\"); it simply says that the selbri is not really applicable. Whether or not the meaning of this word is within the generic semantic range of \"{zo'e}\" is debatable and not yet well-established. The conventions employed matter. The case of the product of zero and infinity usually must be handled by a separate definition (especially when dealing only with strictly real numbers); it is quite common to explicitly handle this case by defining the product as zero, but prior to such definition, \"lo pilji be li no bei li ci'i\" is meaningless and undefined (the symbols can be written but do not actually mean anything) - so, $pilji_1$ should be filled with this word in such a circumstance. As another example, unless the difference of infinity with infinity is defined (and following the convention that unconnected points have a graph distance of positive countable infinity), which is unnatural, the relationship represented by \"{tseingu}\" is undefined in its fourth terbri (so, it can be filled with this word) when its first and second sumti belong to mutually different trees (leaving their most recent mutually common ancestor undefined). Notice that the other terbri are well-defined in this circumstance - in particular, $tseingu_3$ is positive countable infinity; also notice that this word has a slightly less mathematical flavor (especially insofar as the first terbri is not result of applying a mathematical operation to the following terbri) than many other ready examples. Yet another example: In a zero-dimensional universe, $klama_4$ and possibly $klama_5$, as well as even more arguably $klama_2$, are undefined (and can be filled with this word), leaving the notion of 'going' empty and meaningless. In a $(-1)$-dimensional universe (an empty set), every terbri of \"{klama}\" (and probably every other word) is undefined and can be filled with this terbri.","KOhA","non-existent it","undefining it","a|4hi|4hj","o|4O7|4he|4hf|4hg|4OB|4hh|4hk","zi'a'o","mathematical operator: the empty/null [one sense]/trivial [one sense]/blank operator","Arity is context-dependent.

Lojban now allows for such functionality: just apply this word to the ordered list (1,2,0) and do not fill the second terbri ($X_2$: the indeterminate). This word can also be viewed as creating an object in a ring. Termination of the list is extremely important; under normal interpretations, list entries can themselves have operations applied internally; moreover, multiple indetermimates can be introduced by careful application of this word to a list wherein each entry is itself treated as a polynomial.

The meaning is context-specific. B = 0 iff C = 0; if A in unprimed (lacks any distinguishing marks), then B = 0; thus all mathematical objects have this operator implicitly attached to them with the value of 0 for the second and third argumentsize (note that this is not the default value for these arguments when this operator is explicitly mentioned).

Place after an imperative construct (such as {ko}) in order to rhetorically command the audience- such as with the English sentence \"Tell me about it\", which actually indicates emphatic and personal agreement rather than a command/request for the details to be explicated or elaborated. Various grammatical structures can be marked as rhetorical flourishes this way; in this capacity, the word might (but need not) operate in a way similar to {pe'a} (such as with, maybe, the phrase \"for forty days and forty nights\" meaning that some event had a long duration and the utterer wishes to reference/bring to mind the Biblical story of Noah's Flood in some way). Of course, whole bridi can be marked by this word. In general, it elevates the understanding of an utterance from literal to something with a purpose or intent and which may not be entirely factual or genuine but, rather, which is being used a tool in the design of a presentation. This word's negative makes it clear that the utterance is to be understood literally or as a genuine, face-value piece of text (although figurative language may still be present- it is only literal in its presentation, so to speak).

Since {pi} belongs to PA, technically at least zero {xo'e}'s can actually be meant to be radix point(s); at most, the total allowable number of radix points in a digit string, less the number of explicitly mentioned {pi}'s that occur therein (within the macrodigit), is the number of {pi}'s that can be referenced elliptically by this means. {ma'u} and {ni'u} are possible references for microdigits where allowed by the base.

For example in English: \"I ain't seen nothin'\" means that the speaker is very emphatically claiming to have seen nothing of interest. This is the standard operation for negation in Spanish. \"Multiplicative negation\" means that negatives cancel, but do not intensify, one another (possibly taking a neutral or abstentional state). \"I did not see nothing\" in this mode means that the speaker did indeed see something. Note that multiplicative double-negatives are not necessarily equivalent to affirmatives in general. \"I like cheese\" is an affirmative statement and is not equivalent to \"I do not dislike cheese\", which is a multiplicative double-negative (and which may indicate a reluctant acceptance of cheese or a neutral feeling toward cheese). In this mode, an even number of negatives in a given statement is not negative and an odd number of negatives in a given statement is not positive. This word applies to all negatives in the text, whether they are free words or rafsi. This word also, but less dramatically, applies to affirmations: in additive mode, multiple affirmatives intensify one another (\"I am indeed very much so going!\" is a strongly emphasized positive statement); in multiplicative mode, they simply reduce to a single affirmation (for like example, \"I am going\"). This means that care must be taken: In additive mode, an affirmative marker will partially cancel with a negative particle in some way, reducing its intensity and possibly bringing it to a neutral statement (\"I am indeed - not - going\" is a neutral statement in this mode, similar to \"I may be going\"; English does not really have the ability to express such things); in multiplicative mode, an affirmative coupled with a negative simply reduces to the negative, possibly strengthened by a factor equivalent to the intensity of the affirmer (\"I am indeed not going\" is a clear way of saying that the speaker will not go).","NEIhAI","double-negative mode toggle","a|55n","o|4O7|55j|55k|55l|4OB|55m|55o","ne'au","attitudinal: devoidness of emotion (neutral by absence of emotion) - overwhelmed by/replete with/overflowing with (seemingly all) emotion","s|Carries no positive or negative connotations.

Then $D(e^x)=0$ at best, strictly speaking, because $x$ must be just a number and so the differentiand is a constant (in fact and at worst, it may not even be a function, in which case the derivative is not even defined); we accept this notation to mean something else (which will be shown momentarily) because few other notations are convenient.

The immediately following (next) unfilled terbri at that level of nesting is affected by this word; if no such terbri exists at that level of nesting, this word's affects apply to the next unfilled terbri in the immediately higher level of nesting (unnested once); if no unfilled terbri exist at any/all levels of nesting and following the immediately previous sumti (even if unfilled terbri exist prior to that sumti), this word has no meaningful affect and can be ignored.  This word must be followed by a sumti; for the purpose of this explanation, this sumti will be xy (as in \"de'ai xy\").  The affected terbri is defined to default to the value xy (the sumti as a whole, including gadri, tanru, relative clauses, etc.); in other words, when not explicitly filled or when filled be {di'au}, the sumti value filling the affected terbri is that of xy.  This affect remains in effect until the end of the text/conversation or until/unless the default setting of this terbri explicitly redefined (overriding by {di'ei} is temporary/only applies to that usage). If xy is {zo'e}, the default value is completely general and elliptical; thus, permanently overriding a default setting on a specific terbri may be done by \"de'ai zo'e\". The scope of this word fully encompasses and ends with the following sumti (xy); thus, the second sumti, same-/higher-level terminator, a FA cmavo, etc. following this word ends the new default specification in addition to its other functions.  Additionally, this word does not actually fill the affected terbri with any particular sumti/value; it merely defines its default value hereinafter. CAUTION: Thus, the second same-level sumti uttered actually fills the affected terbri; in order to access the newly-defined default value of the terbri immediately after definition, follow \"xy\" (with terminator) immediately with implicit (or possibly explicit) \"{zo'e}\" (possibly necessitating terminators), \"{di'au}\", or \"xy\" itself. Moreover, therefore, the default value defined by this word does not immediately/necessarily affect the truth value of the statement in which it appears (it only does so if the second following sumti is not {di'au}, implicit (or possibly) explicit {zo'e}, or xy itself); however, in all future uses of the brivla to which the terbri belongs, unless explicitly filled with a sumti of a different value, the truth value of those statements will be affected.  Also, {su} does not erase this new definition of default. If the affected terbri is naturally defined to have a default or if it has no naturally defined default value, this word semi-permanently over-writes them.

The terbri are not filled by this word. Usage is only meaningful for a brivla with at least one terbri (regardless of being explicitly filled or otherwise). In a tanru or other complicated construct, only the most recent word undergoes this terbri default override (not every term in the construct).

If $m$ is defined, then its contextless default value is $m = 0$. This function/word first determines the base being used for interpretation of digit strings (determined by context or by explicit specification (JUhAU)) for/as applied to $x$; this determination takes place even before inputs are accepted after $x$; let this base be represented by $b$ throughout this description unless $b$ is explicitly specified as an input. In such case, if the base of $x$ is a positional system wherein each digit represents a corresponding multiple of a fixed natural number raised to the power of its position (as determined relative to the radix point) and wherein the overall number is the sum of these results/representands, or if $b$ is explicitly specified as an input, then $t$ is defined; if the base of $x$ is sufficiently bad or unclear and $b$ is not explicitly specified as an input, then $t$ is undefined. Of course, if $b$ is explicitly specified as an input, then that value (if valid) is the meaning of \"$b$\" throughout this description. If $t$ is undefined, then its slot is automatically and implicitly deleted from this word in that context (so the operator is at-most-3-ary and its input acceptance is terminated by the '$n$' xor '$m$' slot, whichever one is later yet defined (because, assumptively, '$b$' is not explicitly specified); if '$m$' is defined and explicitly uttered when '$t$' is undefined and the '$x$' and '$n$' values have been explicitly specified, then the third input is '$m$') and \"$b^t$\" $=$ \"$b^{(-t)}$\" $= b = 1$ formally for the purposes of this definition (but not necessarily for the base for any digit-to-number interpretation/conversion, particularly on $x$!). If $t$ is defined, then its contextless default value is $t = 0$. The rounding function, determined by $n$, is performed on $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$. If $n = 1$, then the rounding function is the ceiling function: $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the least integer that is greater than or equal to it; in other words, it rounds up. If $n = -1$, then the rounding function is the floor function: $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the greatest integer that is less than or equal to it; in other words, it rounds down. These integers are both determined by the ordering and metric. If $n = 0$, then the rounding function maps $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ to the integer that minimizes the metric distance between itself and $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ if a unique such integer exists (id est: $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the nearest integer, where \"nearest\"-ness is determined according to the order and metric); if no such unique integer exists, then $(b^{(-t)})$abs$(x)$ is mapped to the unique integer among these aforementioned options for which there exists an integer $Z$ such that $2Z+m$ is the integer in question; if no unique such integer exists, then the function is undefined. Thus, $n = 0$ produces the commonly used unbiased nearest-integer rounding function. In each of these cases, the output of the rounding function is then multiplied by sgn$(x) b^{t}$. Thus, it rounds at the $t$th digit if $b$ matches the base of $x$ and else to the nearest multiple of $b$ in the $t$th digit of abs$(x)$, so to speak. Notice that rounding up or down always is applied to the absolute value, so it is really rounding (positive or negative) infinity-ward or zeroward respectively. The order on, and the operators and metric endowing, the metric space and field of all real numbers is determined by context or by explicit specification. The absolute value function is denoted as \"abs( )\" in the definition, and the signum function sgn is such that sgn$(z) = z/$abs$(z)$ for all real $z:$ abs$(z) > 0$, and sgn$(0) = 0$.","ceiling function","floor function","nearest integer function","round down","rounding function","round to nearest integer","round up","a|5A6|5A7|5A8|5A9|5AA|5AB|5AC","o|4O7|5A3|5A4|5A5|4OB|4Oe|5AD","mu'i'u","base-dependent digit: representing exactly one half of one more than the maximum possible single-digit number expressible in the relevant number base","s|Some pathologies are possible.

The construct as a whole syntactically functions as a parenthetical so that mekso may be resumed immediately thereafter without any difficulty. This word attaches to/affects the immediately preceding macrodigit string extending from the last evaluated number, number operation, etc. or bracket to/until this word. The preceding number is semantically interpreted according to the description to which the following sumti refers. If a sequence is supplied as the following sumti, the preceding number is interpreted so that each digit, starting from the left (default: see next), is understood as a multiple of the corresponding value in the sequence under the ordering given (which may produce an invalid/ill-formed result; the placement of {pi} matters as well).  If a single number is submitted (such as \"li {dau}\"), this word acts as {ju'u}; the number is interpreted according to the rules of mekso and is its own island for such interpretation (thus {ju'u} is needed to override a cultural/grammatical default interpretation, such as decimal, even if this is done within the mekso expression outside of and including the scope of this word). In this way, the sumti being (10^n)_n, which is a sequence, is the same as the sumti being just 10, but is very different from it being the sequence (10)_n.  The original default for numeral-position/string reading/interpretation is from left-to-right, where a digit on the left in a pair of digits represents that multiple of a \"later\" term in the sequence as compared to right member of the pair; thus \"23\" in decimal means (2*(10^1)) + (3*(10^0)), which is twenty-three.  This default may be overridden via specification of the sequence (either its ordering, its domain being negated, or alteration to the base); alternatively, and perhaps more easily, the appearance of \"la'e zoi jbo. ri'u bi'o zu'a .jbo\" will always reverse it (this is a special input value with interpretation defined by this grammar); when reversed, \"23\" in decimal means (2*(10^0)) + (3*(10^1)), which is to say thirty-two.  Generally, this word overrides the default interpretation of a string of microdigits when computing the value of a macrodigit (see: {ju'u'i}).

By default, the macrodigit is interpreted as being written/expressed in some cultural or grammatical default (this default is overridden by {ju'au} if its specifying sumti requires an alternative interpretation for the value of the macrodigits), probably decimal- the interpretation of the string of microdigits produces a number, x; the \"{pi'e}\" implies the denominator to be used in determining the fraction for which x is in the numerator and context or possibly a specified base determines its value- in timekeeping, the interpretation is typically x/60 for certain macrodigits. However, the default for determining the value of x given a string of microdigits might be useful to override (for example, Tsohnai uses an overall factorial base but each macrodigit is written in balanced quinary); this word specifies the base used for interpreting the macrodigit from a string of microdigits. It is placed at the end of the string (possibly before the next \"{pi'e}\") and its scope of effect extends from there, through the string of microdigits, to either the beginning of the number as a whole or the most recent \"{pi'e}\" (whichsoever was more recently uttered). It is to be followed by a sumti (or multiple sumti strung together by connectives) and has its scope of specification terminate with that sumti; in this regard, it works syntactically and semantically exactly like {ju'au}. In fact, {ju'au} can be used outside of the number in order to specify the macrodigit interpretation instead of this word (for example, if its sumti were la .tsonais., this word would not be needed); however, if only a sequence were to have been given as the argument of {ju'au} (such as the factorial sequence) and if some base other than decimal were desired for the interpretation of each macrodigit from the string of microdigits, then this word would be used. If only one macrodigit appears in the number, then this word is equivalent to {ju'au}. In short, the scope of this word is one contiguous string of microdigits, and it influences their interpretation into a macrodigit value in the same way that {ju'au} does.

The ith term in tuple X2 is replaced with the ith term in tuple X3; the replacements are executed simultaneously (thus, no overlap/contradiction can be allowed to arise in the substitution- in particular, in X2)  - alternatively, if there is overlap/conflict in/between the terms of X2, the replacements are performed in order of presentation (the ith term in X2 is replaced by the ith term in X3, and then the (i+1)th term in X2 is replaced with the (i+1)th term in X3, starting with the 1st term in each). X2 and X3 must have the same length/number of terms - alternatively, X3 cannot be longer/have more terms than X2; in this situation, the ith term of X2 is replaced with the ith term of X3 until and including when the last term of X3 is reached, after which point the remaining terms in X2 are not replaced at all. Use a permutation acting on X2 as the argument for X3 in order to rearrange the substrings of X1; if the alphabet is ordered, then operators can be applied to the letters in order to rotate through the alphabet. In particular, if X1 is a binary string (a word over an alphabet of two letters) and X2 is the 2-tuple of the letters of that binary alphabet (length-1 substrings), then without specification of X3, this operator defaults to bitwise binary negation (bit conjugation) wherein each letter in X1 is replaced by the unique other letter in the binary alphabet (otherwise, the replacement would be the identity/trivial replacement or just a formal substitution letter-by-letter which does not really change the nature of the word). X1 and each entry in X2 and X3 should be quoted, match a necessary type (such as being a character), or be abstracted a level by symbolics. In general, the replacement is formal and the strings in X3 need not be over the same alphabet as the one over which X1 is written. This operator is useful for combinatorial lines and for expanding digits (such as, in a binary string, replacing each occurrence of \"0\" with \"01\" and each occurrence of \"1\" with \"10\"; note that the replacement is instantaneous and simultaneous for all terms of X2 and every occurrence of such terms in X1, thus this substitution is perfectly acceptable).","bit conjugation","bitwise binary negation","combinatorial line","digit expansion","find-and-replace","a|5Ir|5Is|5It|5Iu|5Iv","o|4O7|5Io|5Ip|5Iq|4OB|4Oe|5Iw","bai'i'i","s|mekso operator: in ordered tuple/list/vector/sequence $X_1$, replace the $X_2$th entry with term $X_3$ of appropriate type, and leave all other entries untouched (optional: where the index for the very first/leading/header entry is $X_4$).","s|$X_1$ must be some ordered and indexed structure; $X_2$ must be an index which specifies an entry/element/term which actually appears in $X_1$; $X_3$ is an alternative value of appropriate type which can, and after this operation does, replace the $X_2$th entry/element/term; the counting for indices is according to explicitly specified or implicit cultural convention, or the natural convention for the circumstance, or (when ambiguous or unclear) starts with 1, unless $X_4$ specifies otherwise (in which case, it is according to that specification). Exactly the $X_2$th entry is reppaced, and it is replaced with exactly $X_3$. For example: in (A, B, C), A is the $X_4$th entry (default: 1st); bai'i'i((A, B, C), 2, b, 1) = (A, b, C). $X_2$ itself could be replaced with a(n ordered) set of index values, in which case $X_3$ must be an ordered list of replacement values such that they have the same cardinality; in this situation, the $n$th index in the index set (according to its ordering) corresponds to an entry in $X_1$ which gets replaced (respectively) by the $n$th entry in $X_3$, where the entries in $X_3$ are themselves counted/indexed/ordered in the usual manner and with the first/leading/header entry being 1st unless somehow explicitly specified otherwise; the index set is automatically ordered according to the same ordering as on $X_3$ unless explicitly specified otherwise. Example: bai'i'i((A, B, C, D, E, F, G), Set(5, 2), (b, e), 1) = (A, b, C, D, e, F, G), where the ordering on $X_2$ and $X_3$ is the standard ordering starting with 1; note that Set(5, 2) is unordered and that the standard ordering rearranges it as (2, 5) with 2 being the 1st entry/element, meaning that the index 2 (corresponding with B in $X_1$) gets linked with the first entry of $X_3$, which is b, meaning that B gets replaced by b in $X_1$.","a|5Iv","o|4O7|5Iy|5Iz|5J0|4OB|4Oe|5J1","dei'o","pro-sumti: this word","mnemonic: dei + zo -> dei'o","this word","a|5J6","o|4O7|5J3|5J4|5J5|4OB|4hh|5J7","mei'u","s|converts sumti into selbri: $x_1$ is [that sumti]'s, among $x_2$, by relationship $x_3$ (binary ka).","s|A replacement for «me SUMTI moi», but without the hack.

Inside the module formed by the \"sei'au\" brackets, at most three sumti (where this counting contracts connected sumti into one) can be specified. The first one is a {mau'au}-{zai'ai} quoted function (which is taken to be the operand of this word); it must be preceded (not necessarily immediately) by {li}; let f be this function. The second and third sumti each are a nonnegative integer (preceded by {li}); call them $n$ and $m$ respectively; $n$ defaults to 1 and $m$ defaults to the next (thus-far unfilled) terbri number for/of the current selbri unless these specifications are overridden by zmico; if the relevant selbri has no terbri following this word, then this default value of $m$ causes this word to have no effect. The $m$th terbri of the selbri to which this construct applies will be passed through f before being filled by any sumti (including {zo'e}, explicit or implicit; terbri numbers start counting at 1 and increase by 1 with each new occurrence) for the next $n$ occurrences of the aforementioned selbri in the discourse (with $n$ = 1 counting the current occurrence; aside: a non-default value of $m$ can thus affect the interpretation of an already-filled terbri of the currently open selbri in an afterthought manner); this counting is only done forward in the discourse/time, including the current selbri, never back through it. Thus, $n$ = 0 effectively neutralizes this word, $n$ being infinite causes the effect to be permanent. f being {zi'a'o} returns the terbri in question to its default value/understanding (according to zmico). It is important to realize that this word does not affect the $m$th terbri of all selbri, just of the one currently open when this word is utterred (no matter where it is positioned/nested in future costructs). If this word is in conflict with another usage of this word over the same terbri, follow the specification applied by the most recent still active occurrence of this construct; this construct is considered to be active for this purpose until its-$n$ occurrences of the appropriate terbri are uttered; thus if the earlier-$n$ is greater than the later-$n$, the later effect takes precedent until it is disactivated, after which point the earlier effect resumes. Define $n$ and  $m$ (and f) outside of the module created by brackets of this word if you wish to reuse them; for the sake of future referencing the value specified within the module, $n$ gets reduced/decremented by 1 at each occurrence of the appropriate terbri until it reaches the value 0 (at which value it remains forever after); if $n$ is a series of connected numbers, this decrementation is applied to each connectand in turn. Use {pi'u} (possibly subscripted) in order to simplify utterances. Especially helpful if f is non-injective. The affected terbri must be referenced by {ce'u} as an operand of f wheresoever it is desired; this reference must be explicit.  Let 'broda' be the currentry open selbri; then this word replaces $broda_m$ with f($broda_m$) in the definition of 'broda' for the next $n$ occurrences of the terbri. For example, if f were {cu'a}, then any sumti which fills $broda_m$ will be understood to be doing so in absolute value.

This word and operator has ordered input: '$X_1$ kei'i $X_2$' is not generally equivalent to '$X_2$ kei'i $X_1$'; in other words, the operator is not commutative. If unary (meaning that $X_1$ is not explicitly specified in a hypothetical expression \"$X_1 - X_2$\"), then $X_1$ is taken to be some universal set $O$ in/of the discourse (of which all other mentioned sets are subsets, at the least); in this case, the word operates as the set (absolute) complement of the explicitly mentioned set here (but not in the definition) designated as $X_2$ for clarity (id est: the output is $O - X_2 = X_{2} ^{C}$, where \"$^{C}$\" denotes the set absolute complement; in other words, it is the set of all elements which may be under consideration such that they are not elements of the explicitly specified set). When binary with both $X_1$ and $X_2$ explicitly specified, this word/operator is the set relative complement.

This word, in appropriate contexts, may be a target interpretation of {xo'e} and/or {xo'ei}; explicit restriction so that the intended digit cannot equal this one would clarify.","blank digit","empty digit","a|5bZ|5ba","o|4O7|5bW|5bX|5bY|4OB|4Qv|5bb","ku'ei","Terminator for a CAhEI phrase.","KUhEI","o|4OH|5bd|5be|4OB|5bf","tu'ei","s|makes a new selbri, the first two places of which are to be filled with sumti from the first two abstraction places of the selbri following this word","'ko'a jai broda tu'a ko'e' = 'ko'a tu'ei broda ko'e'","o|4Oa|5bh|5bi|5bj|4OB|4aN","ku'au'i","categorizer/hashtag","s|Differs from {sau'e'u} in that this word denotes the general body of subjects to which the discourse is related by focus. {sau'e'u} denotes the specific manifestation/substantiation of those topics in a given, indicated form.

See also: {skari}, {blabi}, {xekri}, {kandi}, {carmi}, {nukni}, {narju}, {rozgu}, {zirpu}, {pelxu}, {xunre}, {cidro}, {lektoni}, {protoni}, {dikca}, {maksi}, {guska'u}, {gusni}, {cradi}. This color is a subset/element (depending on interpretation/usage) of the colors associated with light in the radio and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Speaker determines how close \"approximately twenty-one centimeters\" is to exactly twenty-one centimeters. Technically can only be used for the coloration of light that would arise from the hyperfine spin-flip transition of a hydrogen atom (without any neutrons) in which the proton-electron quantum spin configuration abruptly changes from parallel to antiparallel in the 1s groundstate.  But other isotopes and/or hydrogenic (id est: single-electron) atoms can be referenced by semantic broadening; note that in any case, this word always refers to the color of the light emitted from such an object. This is a color, not a description of the process, conditions under which the light of this color is emitted, etc., nor is it the light itself nor wavelength of the light.  However, this term probably will come up in all such descriptions.  For example, \"hyperfine spin-flip transition\" might be rendered {xipfne binxo}. Technically, any object that emits photons with wavelengths of approximately twenty-one centimeters will be of the color xipfne, regardless of why such emission is occurring (id est: it need not be due to hydrogen hyperfine, proton/electron spin-flip transitions).  Usage in such a case is perfectly acceptable.  However, in practice, such occasions/contexts will be rare (essentially completely absent except in theory) and the only common usage will be in the context of hydrogen hyperfine proton/electron spin-flip transitions (as in astronomy, chemistry, or quantum mechanics).

The entry for this cmavo compound is essentially a proposal to redefine the {va'i} spectrum slightly, to make it a little more like the similar discursive {ta'u}. Consider the English sentences: (A) \"Gold has atomic number 79, in other words, there are 79 protons in a gold nucleus.\" (B) \"There are 79 protons in a gold nucleus, in other words, gold has atomic number 79.\" In English, in both A and B, the parts are discursively connected by the same \"in other words\" connective, even though the connection is in two mutually opposite directions. To understand that there really is a difference between the two, consider another pair of sentences: (A') \"According to the Bible, God made the world in six days, in other words, it took almost a week to make everything around us.\" (B') \"According to the Bible, it took almost a week to make everything around us, in other words, God made the world in six days.\" Unlike A and B, from among the pair A' and B', only A' makes sense, B' sounds absurd. The proposal is to redefine Lojban's {va'i} and {va'i} {nai}, in the motivation to give {va'i} {nai} more of a use, to reflect this very Lojbanic difference in direction, which English cannot capture. This compound, i.e. \"va'i cu'i\" would then acquire the meaning of \"in the same words\". There is no set in stone rule for which of {va'i} and {va'i} {nai} stands for which direction for any given two pair of sentences: however, if one of them is used to connect them in one way, then the other one would connect them in the reverse order. \"broda .i va'i nai brode\" simply is defined as equivalent to \"brode .i va'i broda\".
