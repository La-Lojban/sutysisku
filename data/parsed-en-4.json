In practice, tick marks are usually called prime marks (and probably will effectively/culturally have a value of C=1); other distinguishing features are employed usually once these are used, such as overbars, over-tildes/over-twiddles, dagger, asterisks, etc. For a fixed C, this operator forms a series in B for each A. The meaning is context-specific. B = 0 iff C = 0; if A in unprimed (lacks any distinguishing marks), then B = 0; thus all mathematical objects have this operator implicitly attached to them with the value of 0 for the second and third argumentsize (note that this is not the default value for these arguments when this operator is explicitly mentioned).

Thus, the indices/labels specified are included in the range of sampling; id est: if the matrix entries listed belong to the ith row and jth column and the (i+n)th row and (j+m)th column respectively (for positive integers i,j,n,m), then the sampling will be conducted in all rows of number between (and including) i and i+n (yielding n+1 sampled rows) and in all columns of number between (and including) j and j+m (yielding m+1 sampled columns). The default diagonal sampling procedure for x4 is as follows: The first sampled entry has the minimum allowed (as specified in x3) indices.  All latter sampled entries (by default) have indices of the immediately previous sampled entry each augmented by 1. (Which is to say that if the kth sampled entry has indices (x,y,...), in that order, then the (k+1)th sampled entry has indices (x+1,y+1,...), in that order and where each subsequent index would be the respective index of the kth sampled entry augmented by 1).  The process terminates generally whenever exactly one entry is sampled from each of the rows, each of the columns, etc. of the tensor.  In the default, the process terminates when at least one of the indices of a sampled entry of the tensor is as large as possible in the range specified by x3. Thus, in order to reconcile the general and the default termination conditions, the range specified by x3 must be compatible with both; id est: it must be a r-dimensional hypercube of entries, so to speak, where r is the rank of tensor x2. The default for sampling range x3 is between and including the entry in the first row and first column (etc.) and the entry in the last row and last column (etc.) for an r-dimensional hypercube tensor (meaning that each row, column, etc. of the tensor has exactly the same number of entries as the others).  Generally, the default range begins with the entry of indices each minimal in the tensor (called 'the first entry') and extends to include (\"draw\") the maximal r-dimensional hypercube of entries in the tensor with one vertex on the first entry; in other words, if the minimum of the set of maximal indices in the tensor is g, then the sampling range is every row between the first and the gth, every column between the first and the gth, etc.  Generally, the sampling range must be an r-dimensional orthotope of some positive size (that is to say: including at least one entry) no larger than the tensor itself, but with the freedom to place at most r of its vertices among the entries thereof; if the default sampling procedure x4 is being used, then the r-dimensional orthotope must be an r-dimensional hypercube. Generalizes to any tensor, but is only interesting for tensors of rank at least 1. Any mention of geometric terminology (such as mention of diagonals, orthotopes, etc.) in the definition or notes of this word should be interpreted cautiously and is not necessarily good Lojbanic practice; such terminology should not necessarily be emulated in practicing Lojbanic thought or speech.

This word must be followed by a sumti; for the purpose of this explanation, this sumti will be xy (as in \"de'ai xy\").  The affected terbri is defined to default to the value xy (the sumti as a whole, including gadri, tanru, relative clauses, etc.); in other words, when not explicitly filled or when filled be {di'au}, the sumti value filling the affected terbri is that of xy.  This affect remains in effect until the end of the text/conversation or until/unless the default setting of this terbri explicitly redefined (overriding by {di'ei} is temporary/only applies to that usage). If xy is {zo'e}, the default value is completely general and elliptical; thus, permanently overriding a default setting on a specific terbri may be done by \"de'ai zo'e\". The scope of this word fully encompasses and ends with the following sumti (xy); thus, the second sumti, same-/higher-level terminator, a FA cmavo, etc. following this word ends the new default specification in addition to its other functions.  Additionally, this word does not actually fill the affected terbri with any particular sumti/value; it merely defines its default value hereinafter. CAUTION: Thus, the second same-level sumti uttered actually fills the affected terbri; in order to access the newly-defined default value of the terbri immediately after definition, follow \"xy\" (with terminator) immediately with implicit (or possibly explicit) \"{zo'e}\" (possibly necessitating terminators), \"{di'au}\", or \"xy\" itself. Moreover, therefore, the default value defined by this word does not immediately/necessarily affect the truth value of the statement in which it appears (it only does so if the second following sumti is not {di'au}, implicit (or possibly) explicit {zo'e}, or xy itself); however, in all future uses of the brivla to which the terbri belongs, unless explicitly filled with a sumti of a different value, the truth value of those statements will be affected.  Also, {su} does not erase this new definition of default. If the affected terbri is naturally defined to have a default or if it has no naturally defined default value, this word semi-permanently over-writes them.

For example, \"li pa ce'o li re\" means \"big-endian\" (the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\") comes first in the sequence and the sequence has exactly two terms), \"li re ce'o li pa\" means \"little-endian\" ((the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\") comes last in the sequence and the sequence has exactly two terms), \"li re ce'o li ci ce'o le pa\" is middle-endian (as in the conventional representation of dates in the U.S. (MM-DD-YYYY); the second most signifant term (represented by \"li re\"; example: month) comes first, the least significant term (represented by \"li ci\"; example: day) comes second, and the most significant term (represented by \"li pa\"; example: year) comes last, and there are exactly three terms), \"li pa ce'o li ci ce'o li re\" is the reverse of the last (example: YYYY-DD-MM). The point is that, while it is cumbersome, this method of filling $x_2$ is generalizable and explicit. \"Bi-endian\" (traditional sense) can be specified by a judicious usage of the word \".{a}\" between the little-endian and big-endian sequences; less conventional endiannesses which could be described as being \"bi-endian\" or even \"$n$-endian\" can be formed by different or more elaborate connectives between such sequences; just worry about grouping of connectives.

Technically, $x_1$ and $x_2$ are symmetric under mutual exchange and can even be equivalent; however, in a manner morally analogous to \"{srana}\", $x_2$ is canonically/traditionally either the common residue (the unique element in the space which is congruent to $x_1$ mod $x_3$ and which is greater than or equal to 0 and strictly less than $x_3$) or the minimal residue (denoting the common residue by $c$, the minimal residue is either $c$ xor $c - x_3$, whichever is strictly less than the other in absolute value), and this may even be considered as its contextless default meaning (such as in \"lo se modju\").

For example in English: \"I ain't seen nothin'\" means that the speaker is very emphatically claiming to have seen nothing of interest. This is the standard operation for negation in Spanish. \"Multiplicative negation\" means that negatives cancel, but do not intensify, one another (possibly taking a neutral or abstentional state). \"I did not see nothing\" in this mode means that the speaker did indeed see something. Note that multiplicative double-negatives are not necessarily equivalent to affirmatives in general. \"I like cheese\" is an affirmative statement and is not equivalent to \"I do not dislike cheese\", which is a multiplicative double-negative (and which may indicate a reluctant acceptance of cheese or a neutral feeling toward cheese). In this mode, an even number of negatives in a given statement is not negative and an odd number of negatives in a given statement is not positive. This word applies to all negatives in the text, whether they are free words or rafsi. This word also, but less dramatically, applies to affirmations: in additive mode, multiple affirmatives intensify one another (\"I am indeed very much so going!\" is a strongly emphasized positive statement); in multiplicative mode, they simply reduce to a single affirmation (for like example, \"I am going\"). This means that care must be taken: In additive mode, an affirmative marker will partially cancel with a negative particle in some way, reducing its intensity and possibly bringing it to a neutral statement (\"I am indeed - not - going\" is a neutral statement in this mode, similar to \"I may be going\"; English does not really have the ability to express such things); in multiplicative mode, an affirmative coupled with a negative simply reduces to the negative, possibly strengthened by a factor equivalent to the intensity of the affirmer (\"I am indeed not going\" is a clear way of saying that the speaker will not go).","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"NEIhAI","g":["double-negative mode toggle"]},{"w":"nei'au","d":"unary mekso operator: $(-1)^x$","n":"Macro for exponentiating -1 by the input, which is an extremely common term.

If this word is followed by a number of/evaluated to a value 0 or 1 (preceded immediately by \"li\"), this value is taken to be an explicit reset of the mode to the value indicated (the value in question is called a seed value). Iff the seed value is 1, the mode is set thereinafter to multiplicative style; iff the seed value is 0, the mode is set thereinafter to additive style. (That is: the seed values represent the identity elements under the operation which the mode emulates.).  No other value, numerical or otherwise (including other sumti or even Boolean values, which actually mean \"truth\" and \"false\", rather than \"1\" and \"0\" respectively, despite common representations), may act as a seed value of this word.  Thus, only in the context of this word being followed by a \"li\"-introduced mekso expression X which evaluates to the numbers 0 or 1 wherein X is not intended to be taken as a seed value of this word must this word be followed by {ku} prior to X; in this case there is no explicit seed value. If this word has no explicit seed value, then this word causes the mode of interpretation of double-negatives to switch between multiplicative style and additive style; an utterance of this word switches the mode to whichever of these two options was not being used immediately previously.  Thus, it is its own terminator/negator.  Lojban default (without context) is in multiplicative mode: \"mi na na nelci\" is nearly equivalent to \"mi nelci\"; double-negatives cancel leaving a positive sense (even if it is not entirely/definitively affirmative). So, one utterance of this word (under standard conventions) in a given discourse will change double-negatives to become additive. This mode is similar to (some) Spanish negation or AAVE negation; multiple negatives compound/add together, intensifying the negativity (subjective truth-value) of an utterance.  In additive mode, \"[zau'e'u] mi na na nelci\" is equivalent to \"mi ba'e na nelci\" or something of the like; \"[zau'e'u] mi na na na na nelci\" would be simply further emphasized (roughly twice as emphatic as the previous example's negation).

If a number is submitted to $x_3$, the options are only li {ni'u}, li {no}, li {ma'u}, and li {ni'u}/{ma'u} {ci'i}; li ni'u ci'i being submitted means that $x_1$ has always been/had $x_2$, it just happens to be increasing in this property too (at the time specified by context); li ni'u (which is taken to be a finite number) means that there was a time prior to the time specified by context such that $x_1$ was/had $x_2$ but such has no always been the case, and also that at the time specified by context, it is increasing in this property; li no means that at the time specified by context, $x_1$ has just attained being/having property $x_2$ and it is also increasing in this respect; li ma'u (which is taken to be a finite positive number) means that $x_1$ is increasing in property $x_2$ at the time determined by context and that it has not yet (at that time) but will eventually (a finite and positive amount of time later) been classified as having that property properly according to $x_4$; li ma'u ci'i means that $x_1$ is increasing in $x_2$ at the time specified by context but that it will never actually manage to achieve having that property according to $x_4$, even if it asymptotically and strictly monotonically approaches that status. The time specified in $x_3$ need not be the time of when $x_1$ is increasing in property $x_2$ (which is specified via {ca} or the like, in the bridi). \"Time\" in the sense of $x_3$ is rather general; for example, it can also just be conditions which were satisfied when attainment is true (such as a subset on which a mathematical function is positive); it is generally an 'IF' statement (id est: attainment might occur at other times or under other conditions). For example, humans, normally, always increase in oldness/age (the context-determined time/conditions of increase in age is (those throughout) the entirety of their life), but are not actually considered old until they reach some age (specified by $x_3$).","t":"fu'ivla","g":["increasing in and having attained property"],"r":["zenbaje"]},{"w":"zelmast","d":"July.","n":"Cf. {mlajukma'i}, {zelmasti}.","t":"cmevla","g":["July"]},{"w":"zelplin","d":"Uranus.","n":"Cf. {zelplini}.","t":"cmevla","g":["Uranus"]},{"w":"zemoi","d":"quantified selbri: convert 7 to ordinal selbri; $x_{1}$ is seventh among $x_{2}$ ordered by rule $x_{3}$.","t":"cmavo-compound","s":"MOI*","g":["is seventh among"]},{"w":"zeno","d":"number/quantity: 70 [seventy].","t":"cmavo-compound","s":"PA*","g":["70"]},{"w":"zenono","d":"number/quantity: 700 [seven hundred].","t":"cmavo-compound","s":"PA*","g":["700"]},{"w":"zertolna'eske","d":"$x_1$ is forensics about $x_2$ based on methodology $x_3$","n":"from {zekri} + {tolna'e} + {saske}","t":"lujvo","g":["forensics","forensic science"]},{"w":"zerxa'u","d":"$x_1$ illegally/unlawfully lives in/occupies location $x_2$ (usually a building); $x_1$ squats $x_2$.","n":"From {zekri} {xabju}.","t":"lujvo","g":["squat"]},{"w":"zevykla","d":"$k_{1}$ comes/goes out/forth towards destination $k_{2}$ from origin $k_{3}$ via route $k_{4}$ using means/vehicle $k_{5}$.","n":"Cf. {ze'o}, {klama}, {barkla}.","t":"lujvo","g":["come out","go forth","go out"]},{"w":"zevypinji","d":"$x_1$ is a penis of $x_2$.","t":"lujvo","g":["penis"]},{"w":"zgamuvjga","d":"$x_1$ is the parallax of $x_2$ as seen by $x_3$ who moves to $x_4$ from $x_5$","n":"Cf. {kesyske}","t":"lujvo","g":["parallax"]},{"w":"zgavinji","d":"$v_1$ is a surveillance aircraft of type/for carrying $v_2$, propelled by $v_3$.","n":"Cf. {zgana}, {vinji}, {jamvinji}.","t":"lujvo","g":["surveillance aircraft"]},{"w":"zgibe'e","d":"$b_1$ is an orchestra, consisting of performers $b_2$, and conducted by $b_3$, performing music $z_1$.","n":"See also {balzgibe'e}.","t":"lujvo","g":["orchestra"]},{"w":"zgica'a","d":"$x_1$=$c_1$ is a musical instrument played by $x_2$=$c_3$.","n":"Cf. {zgike}, {cabra}.","t":"lujvo","g":["musical instrument"]},{"w":"zgifau","d":"$f_1$ is a musical event with music $x_2$=$z_1$ performed/produced by $x_3$=$z_2$ (event).","t":"lujvo","g":["musical event"]},{"w":"zgifi'i","d":"$f_1$ composes music $f_2$=$z_1$ for purpose $f_3$.","t":"lujvo","g":["composer"]},{"w":"zgigri","d":"$x_1$=$z_2$=$g_1$ is a band that has members $x_2$ and plays music $x_3$=$z_1$.","n":"See also {zgike}, {girzu}","t":"lujvo","g":["band"]},{"w":"zgikabri","d":"$k_1$ is a glass harp/musical glass, performed by $z_2$ (event).","t":"lujvo","g":["glass harp","musical glasses","verrilion"]},{"w":"zgika'u","d":"$k_1$ is a music note (tone).","n":"Cf. {zgike}, {kantu}, {zgika'usni}.","t":"lujvo","g":["music note","note"]},{"w":"zgika'usni","d":"$s_1$ is a music note (symbol).","n":"Cf. {zgike}, {kantu}, {sinxa}, {zgika'u}, {zgica'a}.","t":"lujvo","g":["music note","note"]},{"w":"zgikemfi'inalka'esefsysajyke'ejvekemsefsyda'atoiflike'ejvejagborkemjilryjvesefsyborxenze'a","d":"$x_1$ is aware that they cannot make music $x_2$ but nevertheless tries and fails to do so, thus increasing their jealousy and self-hatred resulting in mind-state $x_3$","n":"Uses experimental gismu {sefsi}","t":"lujvo"},{"w":"zgimi'i","d":"Jukebox $x_1$ plays music $x_2$.","t":"lujvo","g":["jukebox"]},{"w":"zgipli","d":"$x_1$ uses instrument $x_2$ to play music $x_3$","t":"lujvo","g":["play"]},{"w":"zgipre","d":"$x_1$=$p_1$=$z_2$ is a musician, associated with music of style/genre/type $x_2$=$z_1$.","n":"Simplified from \"selzgipre\" by eliding \"se\" from the seltau.

For example, a two-year-old is older than a one-year-old but neither is old by normal human standards.

So, an octagenarian is older than a toddler, and the former (but not the latter) actually is old by normal human standards. In my cases, if $x_4 = 2$, then not only does $x_2$ have property $x_3$, but $x_1$ also has property $x_3$ (just by a greater amount/to a greater extent); it is uncommon and indicative of a pathology in definition for $x_4 = 2$ to not imply that $x_4 = 1$ is also true. The converse is untrue: $x_1$ may have property $x_3$ even while $x_2$ does not ('$x_4 = 1$' is true but '$x_4 = 2$' is false, as in the octagenerian versus toddler example); however, in order to exclude the possibility that $x_4 = 2$ when $x_4 = 1$ is specified, one must explicitly specify that it is so - $x_4$ necessarily tells which argument does indeed satisfy the proposition of having property $x_3$, but it possibly may not necessarily give any information as to which argument does not do so.

A bound on a function is really a bound on the image (set; $x_2$) of the function's domain set under the operation of the function; otherwise, it is sumti-raising. $x_3$ accepts either a directional vector (normalized) / a point on the unit circle (in which case the direction from the origin to that point is the direction which is being considered), or exactly one of li {ma'u} and li {ni'u}; it is unlikely that any other input would be acceptable.  \"{ma'u}\" causes the bound to be an upper bound (a bound on the positive side or the 'right'/'above' when plotted using typical Western European conventions) - it is a number which exceeds/is greater than or equal to every element of $x_2$ in the set underlying $x_4$ according to the order endowing $x_4$. \"{ni'u}\" causes the bound to be an lower bound (a bound on the negative side or the 'left'/'below' when plotted using typical Western European conventions) - it is a number which is less than or equal to every element of $x_2$ in the set underlying $x_4$ according to the order endowing $x_4$. In order to be well-defined, all elements of $x_2$ united with the singleton of $x_1$ must be ordered according to the ordering endowing $x_4$; if $x_4$ lacks a good order, then $x_1$ is undefined. $x_4$ must be an ordered structure, not simply a set. Warning: If $x_3$ is explicitly filled, that is the only direction which is to be assumed.  If it is not explicitly filled, only one (or, arguably, possibly zero) direction(s) is(/are) to be assumed; in this context, it is to be inferred that the set $x_2$ is (possibly) bounded on at least one side/in at least one direction.  Connecting arguments by 'AND' in $x_3$ implies that $x_2$ is the set formed by the singleton of $x_3$; it is NOT the equivalent to the English term \"bound(ed)\" without qualifiers/adjectives (for that meaning, use modulus/absolute value/norm on the input of $x_1$). The bound is not strict (proposal: use {praperi} for this sense), but must be true of all elements of $x_2$ in that direction ($x_3$); it is not necessarily the extremal/best finite bound on $x_2$. $x_1$ is typically finite; submitting any infinity for it is arguably bad form but would imply that no element of $x_2$ is infinite on the side determined by $x_3$ (where \"infinite\" has meaning determined also by $x_4$; again, for \"finite\", use modulus/absolute value/norm) - no other information (about its being bounded or unbounded) can be discerned (unless the sumti in $x_3$ and/or $x_4$ are incompatible). For explicit statement of unboundedness (in a more general sense, possibly including ill-definition of what \"boundedness\" even means in this context) in the direction determined by $x_3$, use {zi'au} as the sumti of $x_1$ (confer earlier note about compatibility of definition and ordering of $x_4$ with $x_2$). $x_4$ can be more exotic than simply the field of real numbers.","t":"fu'ivla","g":["bounded set","lower bound","set of only finite elements","unbounded set","upper bound"],"r":["zmaumce"]},{"w":"zo'anjo","d":"$x_1$ (linear manifold, vector, etc.) is/lies tangent to $x_2$ (object, surface, curve, manifold, etc.) at point/locus $x_3$, by standard/definition/in system $x_4$.","n":"No necessary implication of co-directionality.

Given the other sumti in the predicate (filling the corresponding terbri), the underlying relation (selbri) is claimed to be invalid in this circumstance. Examples: \"non-integrable\", \"non-measurable\" (confer: \".{umre}\"), \"non-summable\" (say, of strings), \"the limit does not exist\". This avoids the necessity of creating a pair of words for every such mathematical concept (one for when the operation may be applied to the inputs so as to yield a well-defined value which may be specified and one for when such is not the case). Other uses may develop or be found. This word does not 'delete' the terbri (unlike \"{zi'o}\"); it simply says that the selbri is not really applicable. Whether or not the meaning of this word is within the generic semantic range of \"{zo'e}\" is debatable and not yet well-established. The conventions employed matter. The case of the product of zero and infinity usually must be handled by a separate definition (especially when dealing only with strictly real numbers); it is quite common to explicitly handle this case by defining the product as zero, but prior to such definition, \"lo pilji be li no bei li ci'i\" is meaningless and undefined (the symbols can be written but do not actually mean anything) - so, $pilji_1$ should be filled with this word in such a circumstance. As another example, unless the difference of infinity with infinity is defined (and following the convention that unconnected points have a graph distance of positive countable infinity), which is unnatural, the relationship represented by \"{tseingu}\" is undefined in its fourth terbri (so, it can be filled with this word) when its first and second sumti belong to mutually different trees (leaving their most recent mutually common ancestor undefined). Notice that the other terbri are well-defined in this circumstance - in particular, $tseingu_3$ is positive countable infinity; also notice that this word has a slightly less mathematical flavor (especially insofar as the first terbri is not result of applying a mathematical operation to the following terbri) than many other ready examples. Yet another example: In a zero-dimensional universe, $klama_4$ and possibly $klama_5$, as well as even more arguably $klama_2$, are undefined (and can be filled with this word), leaving the notion of 'going' empty and meaningless. In a $(-1)$-dimensional universe (an empty set), every terbri of \"{klama}\" (and probably every other word) is undefined and can be filled with this terbri.","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"KOhA","g":["non-existent it","undefining it"]},{"w":"zi'e'a","d":"converts a following bu-letteral into a sumti representing the musical natural note with that name.","n":"The next bu-letteral is absorbed and a natural accidental is given to it; e.g. \"zi'e'a gy\" means \"the note G-natural\".

A selbri converted to a sumti by gadri has x1 terbri filled for the purposes of this word; likewise is the case for terbri accessed by {be} or {bei}; seltau in the main level of a sumti are filled by the gadri as well for the purposes of this word.","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"ZIhOI","g":["nonexistent terbri deletion"]},{"w":"zu'ai","d":"shows mutual activity between this place and the first place of the current bridi; members participating in the activity are put into the first place (that e.g. can be formed by connecting sumti with {ce} or {jo'u})","n":"See also {simxu}, {zi'o}","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"KOhA7","g":["each other"]},{"w":"zu'au","d":"location tense relation/direction (angular); counterclockwise from..., locally leftwards/to the left of ...","n":"See also: {zucna}, {du'oi}.","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"FAhA2","g":["counterclockwise from"]},{"w":"zu'i'a","d":"typically what?","n":"Ask what {zu'i} in the place means.

This color is a subset/element (depending on interpretation/usage) of the colors associated with light in the radio and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Speaker determines how close \"approximately twenty-one centimeters\" is to exactly twenty-one centimeters. Technically can only be used for the coloration of light that would arise from the hyperfine spin-flip transition of a hydrogen atom (without any neutrons) in which the proton-electron quantum spin configuration abruptly changes from parallel to antiparallel in the 1s groundstate.  But other isotopes and/or hydrogenic (id est: single-electron) atoms can be referenced by semantic broadening; note that in any case, this word always refers to the color of the light emitted from such an object. This is a color, not a description of the process, conditions under which the light of this color is emitted, etc., nor is it the light itself nor wavelength of the light.  However, this term probably will come up in all such descriptions.  For example, \"hyperfine spin-flip transition\" might be rendered {xipfne binxo}. Technically, any object that emits photons with wavelengths of approximately twenty-one centimeters will be of the color xipfne, regardless of why such emission is occurring (id est: it need not be due to hydrogen hyperfine, proton/electron spin-flip transitions).  Usage in such a case is perfectly acceptable.  However, in practice, such occasions/contexts will be rare (essentially completely absent except in theory) and the only common usage will be in the context of hydrogen hyperfine proton/electron spin-flip transitions (as in astronomy, chemistry, or quantum mechanics). This is an electromagnetic (id est: light, photon) color.  It is physical (being derived from the properties of the wavelength of the emitted and received photon(s)), but is interpreted by some instrument (such as a telescope/camera system, an animal's optical system, etc.).
