For example in English: \"I ain't seen nothin'\" means that the speaker is very emphatically claiming to have seen nothing of interest. This is the standard operation for negation in Spanish. \"Multiplicative negation\" means that negatives cancel, but do not intensify, one another (possibly taking a neutral or abstentional state). \"I did not see nothing\" in this mode means that the speaker did indeed see something. Note that multiplicative double-negatives are not necessarily equivalent to affirmatives in general. \"I like cheese\" is an affirmative statement and is not equivalent to \"I do not dislike cheese\", which is a multiplicative double-negative (and which may indicate a reluctant acceptance of cheese or a neutral feeling toward cheese). In this mode, an even number of negatives in a given statement is not negative and an odd number of negatives in a given statement is not positive. This word applies to all negatives in the text, whether they are free words or rafsi. This word also, but less dramatically, applies to affirmations: in additive mode, multiple affirmatives intensify one another (\"I am indeed very much so going!\" is a strongly emphasized positive statement); in multiplicative mode, they simply reduce to a single affirmation (for like example, \"I am going\"). This means that care must be taken: In additive mode, an affirmative marker will partially cancel with a negative particle in some way, reducing its intensity and possibly bringing it to a neutral statement (\"I am indeed - not - going\" is a neutral statement in this mode, similar to \"I may be going\"; English does not really have the ability to express such things); in multiplicative mode, an affirmative coupled with a negative simply reduces to the negative, possibly strengthened by a factor equivalent to the intensity of the affirmer (\"I am indeed not going\" is a clear way of saying that the speaker will not go).","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"NEIhAI","g":["double-negative mode toggle"]},{"w":"nei'au","d":"unary mekso operator: $(-1)^x$","n":"Macro for exponentiating -1 by the input, which is an extremely common term.

One of the main differences between rectangular polyplets and polyominoes is that polyominoes cannot have their polytope tiles touching only at their vertices whereas polyplets can (thus, polyominoes are a subset of the rectangular polyplets); this difference can be specified in the final terbri. A tiling of a space may be considered to be an infinite polyform, but that is rather pathological and we can reasonably assume that polyforms referenced by this word will be finite. The polyform is considered to be a unified whole entity. The ambient space is usually going to be the Euclidean space of the same dimension as the polytopes (and the former dimension cannot be exceeded by the latter except in the marginal case of lower-dimensional (id est: hyperplanar) arrangements, in which case parallel cross-sections are really being considered); this space determines the rigid-motion/symmetry isomorphisms of various polyforms (Z and S tetraminoes are non-isomorphic under rigid-motion in the Euclidean plane but are so isomorphic in Euclidean 3-space). The ambient space also determines the expression of (and indeed the 'allowed') polytopes: spherical geometry allows for digons to be arranged so as to form a polyform, but Euclidean 2-space prohibits such objects from the set of possible polygons. The default polytope will probably be a 2-dimensional square; thus the default ambient space will likely be Euclidean 2-space.

The last entry in $X_1$ must be 'constant' term (when understood as a function), so care must be taken to explicitly mention an appropriate number of zeroes.

if the input to $X_2$ is +1, then the type of extreme(ness) is greatness, so maximal elements are listed (starting from the greatest element in the underlying set according to the order which endows it); not even li {ni'u} nor li {ma'u} on their own are accepted in $X_2$.  All input for $X_3$ must be a nonnegative and finite integer, {ro}, or countable infinity ({ci'ino}); nontrivial input for $X_3$ must is a positive, finite natural number which is less than or equal to the cardinality of the set underlying $X_1$;

submit 0 for $X_3$ in order to return the empty list; submit {ci'ino} in order to do the same as {ro}, but only if the set is countably infinite and is discrete (has only isolated points). If the set does not attain its supremum (if $X_2$ = +1) or infimum (if $X_2$ = -1), then the list is empty. Provided that the list is well-defined and nonempty, then the input of $X_3$ can be augmented by +1 only if any interval around the last element of the list produced with the previous value of $X_3$ which extends in the ($-X_2$)-direction intersected with the set underlying $X_1$ is either empty or has an ($X_2$)-determined-extreme element which is isolated and there exists at least one nonempty interval.

This operator produces the first $X_3$ most $X_2$-type-extreme elements of $X_1$ in order starting from the very most extreme of that type.

When it is well-defined (and the inputs, excluding $m$ are fixed by context), denote $z_{m} = -i * ext((A,<),i,n)|_{m}$. Then $ext((A,<),i,n)$ equals a list of length n wherein each entry is an element of $A$ and if n>1, then for any natural number $m<n$, the following is true: $z_{m} < z_{m+1}$; and, moreover, there exists no element $y$ in $A$ such that $z_{m} < -i*y < z_{m+1}$.

The second and third sumti each are a nonnegative integer (preceded by {li}); call them $n$ and $m$ respectively; $n$ defaults to 1 and $m$ defaults to the next (thus-far unfilled) terbri number for/of the current selbri unless these specifications are overridden by zmico; if the relevant selbri has no terbri following this word, then this default value of $m$ causes this word to have no effect. The $m$th terbri of the selbri to which this construct applies will be passed through f before being filled by any sumti (including {zo'e}, explicit or implicit; terbri numbers start counting at 1 and increase by 1 with each new occurrence) for the next $n$ occurrences of the aforementioned selbri in the discourse (with $n$ = 1 counting the current occurrence; aside: a non-default value of $m$ can thus affect the interpretation of an already-filled terbri of the currently open selbri in an afterthought manner); this counting is only done forward in the discourse/time, including the current selbri, never back through it. Thus, $n$ = 0 effectively neutralizes this word, $n$ being infinite causes the effect to be permanent. f being {zi'a'o} returns the terbri in question to its default value/understanding (according to zmico). It is important to realize that this word does not affect the $m$th terbri of all selbri, just of the one currently open when this word is utterred (no matter where it is positioned/nested in future costructs). If this word is in conflict with another usage of this word over the same terbri, follow the specification applied by the most recent still active occurrence of this construct; this construct is considered to be active for this purpose until its-$n$ occurrences of the appropriate terbri are uttered; thus if the earlier-$n$ is greater than the later-$n$, the later effect takes precedent until it is disactivated, after which point the earlier effect resumes. Define $n$ and  $m$ (and f) outside of the module created by brackets of this word if you wish to reuse them; for the sake of future referencing the value specified within the module, $n$ gets reduced/decremented by 1 at each occurrence of the appropriate terbri until it reaches the value 0 (at which value it remains forever after); if $n$ is a series of connected numbers, this decrementation is applied to each connectand in turn. Use {pi'u} (possibly subscripted) in order to simplify utterances. Especially helpful if f is non-injective. The affected terbri must be referenced by {ce'u} as an operand of f wheresoever it is desired; this reference must be explicit.  Let 'broda' be the currentry open selbri; then this word replaces $broda_m$ with f($broda_m$) in the definition of 'broda' for the next $n$ occurrences of the terbri. For example, if f were {cu'a}, then any sumti which fills $broda_m$ will be understood to be doing so in absolute value.

An answer is a SE string that is allowed by the selbri and by the subscripts; continuing the example, if the response is 'Ralph went to C from B', one would respond with '.i {setese}'.  Any SE word works for the general question possibility (which is the unrestricted/non-subscripted case). Essentially 'se'u'o xi sy' is equivalent to 'se xi li xo poi ke'a cmima sy' (where '{te}' is basically understood as ' se xi li jo'i pa boi ci te'u ', etc.), but the answer can be a complicated ordered sequence/string of SE words; this word complements specifically {fi'a} in the typical/same way that SE complements FA. Typically, leaving the subscripted set vague or not completely free of every possible semantic or syntactic pathology is perfectly fine; syntax and practicality will typically restrict it enough for reasonable responses to be made.
