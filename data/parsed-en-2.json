Thus, the indices/labels specified are included in the range of sampling; id est: if the matrix entries listed belong to the ith row and jth column and the (i+n)th row and (j+m)th column respectively (for positive integers i,j,n,m), then the sampling will be conducted in all rows of number between (and including) i and i+n (yielding n+1 sampled rows) and in all columns of number between (and including) j and j+m (yielding m+1 sampled columns). The default diagonal sampling procedure for x4 is as follows: The first sampled entry has the minimum allowed (as specified in x3) indices.  All latter sampled entries (by default) have indices of the immediately previous sampled entry each augmented by 1. (Which is to say that if the kth sampled entry has indices (x,y,...), in that order, then the (k+1)th sampled entry has indices (x+1,y+1,...), in that order and where each subsequent index would be the respective index of the kth sampled entry augmented by 1).  The process terminates generally whenever exactly one entry is sampled from each of the rows, each of the columns, etc. of the tensor.  In the default, the process terminates when at least one of the indices of a sampled entry of the tensor is as large as possible in the range specified by x3. Thus, in order to reconcile the general and the default termination conditions, the range specified by x3 must be compatible with both; id est: it must be a r-dimensional hypercube of entries, so to speak, where r is the rank of tensor x2. The default for sampling range x3 is between and including the entry in the first row and first column (etc.) and the entry in the last row and last column (etc.) for an r-dimensional hypercube tensor (meaning that each row, column, etc. of the tensor has exactly the same number of entries as the others).  Generally, the default range begins with the entry of indices each minimal in the tensor (called 'the first entry') and extends to include (\"draw\") the maximal r-dimensional hypercube of entries in the tensor with one vertex on the first entry; in other words, if the minimum of the set of maximal indices in the tensor is g, then the sampling range is every row between the first and the gth, every column between the first and the gth, etc.  Generally, the sampling range must be an r-dimensional orthotope of some positive size (that is to say: including at least one entry) no larger than the tensor itself, but with the freedom to place at most r of its vertices among the entries thereof; if the default sampling procedure x4 is being used, then the r-dimensional orthotope must be an r-dimensional hypercube. Generalizes to any tensor, but is only interesting for tensors of rank at least 1.

The immediately following (next) unfilled terbri at that level of nesting is affected by this word; if no such terbri exists at that level of nesting, this word's affects apply to the next unfilled terbri in the immediately higher level of nesting (unnested once); if no unfilled terbri exist at any/all levels of nesting and following the immediately previous sumti (even if unfilled terbri exist prior to that sumti), this word has no meaningful affect and can be ignored.  This word must be followed by a sumti; for the purpose of this explanation, this sumti will be xy (as in \"de'ai xy\").  The affected terbri is defined to default to the value xy (the sumti as a whole, including gadri, tanru, relative clauses, etc.); in other words, when not explicitly filled or when filled be {di'au}, the sumti value filling the affected terbri is that of xy.  This affect remains in effect until the end of the text/conversation or until/unless the default setting of this terbri explicitly redefined (overriding by {di'ei} is temporary/only applies to that usage). If xy is {zo'e}, the default value is completely general and elliptical; thus, permanently overriding a default setting on a specific terbri may be done by \"de'ai zo'e\". The scope of this word fully encompasses and ends with the following sumti (xy); thus, the second sumti, same-/higher-level terminator, a FA cmavo, etc. following this word ends the new default specification in addition to its other functions.  Additionally, this word does not actually fill the affected terbri with any particular sumti/value; it merely defines its default value hereinafter. CAUTION: Thus, the second same-level sumti uttered actually fills the affected terbri; in order to access the newly-defined default value of the terbri immediately after definition, follow \"xy\" (with terminator) immediately with implicit (or possibly explicit) \"{zo'e}\" (possibly necessitating terminators), \"{di'au}\", or \"xy\" itself. Moreover, therefore, the default value defined by this word does not immediately/necessarily affect the truth value of the statement in which it appears (it only does so if the second following sumti is not {di'au}, implicit (or possibly) explicit {zo'e}, or xy itself); however, in all future uses of the brivla to which the terbri belongs, unless explicitly filled with a sumti of a different value, the truth value of those statements will be affected.  Also, {su} does not erase this new definition of default. If the affected terbri is naturally defined to have a default or if it has no naturally defined default value, this word semi-permanently over-writes them.

The terbri are not filled by this word. Usage is only meaningful for a brivla with at least one terbri (regardless of being explicitly filled or otherwise). In a tanru or other complicated construct, only the most recent word undergoes this terbri default override (not every term in the construct). A selbri converted to a sumti by gadri has the x1 terbri filled for the purposes of this word, but the default setting of that terbri is so overridden all the same; likewise is the case for terbri accessed by {be} or {bei}; seltau in the main level of a sumti are filled by the gadri as well for the purposes of this word.

The ith term in tuple X2 is replaced with the ith term in tuple X3; the replacements are executed simultaneously (thus, no overlap/contradiction can be allowed to arise in the substitution- in particular, in X2)  - alternatively, if there is overlap/conflict in/between the terms of X2, the replacements are performed in order of presentation (the ith term in X2 is replaced by the ith term in X3, and then the (i+1)th term in X2 is replaced with the (i+1)th term in X3, starting with the 1st term in each). X2 and X3 must have the same length/number of terms - alternatively, X3 cannot be longer/have more terms than X2; in this situation, the ith term of X2 is replaced with the ith term of X3 until and including when the last term of X3 is reached, after which point the remaining terms in X2 are not replaced at all. Use a permutation acting on X2 as the argument for X3 in order to rearrange the substrings of X1; if the alphabet is ordered, then operators can be applied to the letters in order to rotate through the alphabet. In particular, if X1 is a binary string (a word over an alphabet of two letters) and X2 is the 2-tuple of the letters of that binary alphabet (length-1 substrings), then without specification of X3, this operator defaults to bitwise binary negation (bit conjugation) wherein each letter in X1 is replaced by the unique other letter in the binary alphabet (otherwise, the replacement would be the identity/trivial replacement or just a formal substitution letter-by-letter which does not really change the nature of the word). X1 and each entry in X2 and X3 should be quoted, match a necessary type (such as being a character), or be abstracted a level by symbolics. In general, the replacement is formal and the strings in X3 need not be over the same alphabet as the one over which X1 is written. This operator is useful for combinatorial lines and for expanding digits (such as, in a binary string, replacing each occurrence of \"0\" with \"01\" and each occurrence of \"1\" with \"10\"; note that the replacement is instantaneous and simultaneous for all terms of X2 and every occurrence of such terms in X1, thus this substitution is perfectly acceptable).","t":"experimental cmavo","s":"VUhU","g":["bit conjugation","bitwise binary negation","combinatorial line","digit expansion","find-and-replace"]},{"w":"bai'i'i","d":"mekso operator: in ordered tuple/list/vector/sequence $X_1$, replace the $X_2$th entry with term $X_3$ of appropriate type, and leave all other entries untouched (optional: where the index for the very first/leading/header entry is $X_4$).","n":"$X_1$ must be some ordered and indexed structure; $X_2$ must be an index which specifies an entry/element/term which actually appears in $X_1$; $X_3$ is an alternative value of appropriate type which can, and after this operation does, replace the $X_2$th entry/element/term; the counting for indices is according to explicitly specified or implicit cultural convention, or the natural convention for the circumstance, or (when ambiguous or unclear) starts with 1, unless $X_4$ specifies otherwise (in which case, it is according to that specification). Exactly the $X_2$th entry is reppaced, and it is replaced with exactly $X_3$. For example: in (A, B, C), A is the $X_4$th entry (default: 1st); bai'i'i((A, B, C), 2, b, 1) = (A, b, C). $X_2$ itself could be replaced with a(n ordered) set of index values, in which case $X_3$ must be an ordered list of replacement values such that they have the same cardinality; in this situation, the $n$th index in the index set (according to its ordering) corresponds to an entry in $X_1$ which gets replaced (respectively) by the $n$th entry in $X_3$, where the entries in $X_3$ are themselves counted/indexed/ordered in the usual manner and with the first/leading/header entry being 1st unless somehow explicitly specified otherwise; the index set is automatically ordered according to the same ordering as on $X_3$ unless explicitly specified otherwise.

An answer is a SE string that is allowed by the selbri and by the subscripts; continuing the example, if the response is 'Ralph went to C from B', one would respond with '.i {setese}'.

Essentially 'se'u'o xi sy' is equivalent to 'se xi li xo poi ke'a cmima sy' (where '{te}' is basically understood as ' se xi li jo'i pa boi ci te'u ', etc.), but the answer can be a complicated ordered sequence/string of SE words; this word complements specifically {fi'a} in the typical/same way that SE complements FA.
