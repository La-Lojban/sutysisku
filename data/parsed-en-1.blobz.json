Making words in Lojban is difficult in a variety of ways, depending on what type of word you're trying to make. Proper {lujvo}-making requires a good grasp of the semantics of the relevant {gismu}; and of {tanru} syntax, especially the scope of various grammatical constructs; knowledge of Lojban morphology and phonotactics to correctly insert y-hyphens where needed and avoid unparseable wordlike forms such as *{tosmabru} and *{slinku'i} (see {valrtosmabru}, {valslinku'i}); and finally, if you want to add your word to the dictionary, facility with the lujvo-scoring algorithm. Making Type 4 {fu'ivla} (or {zi'evla}), on the other hand, presents the challenge of knowing, out of hundreds of wordlike phonological patterns, which will parse as  single-morpheme words and which will not. (For example, the nonce word {kadvati} will parse but *{kazvati} will not; {fra'aso} will but *{fra'asoi} will not; {kadnazbakai} will but {kadnazbackai} is a actually a lujvo.) Making Type 3 fu'ivla is comparatively easy, but still requires knowing how to use hyphen phonemes right and, of course, how to not violate phonotactical rules when lojbanizing foreign words. Luckily, the work of checking potential word forms can be mostly automated now, if you have access to {sutysisku} or {jbovlaste}.","Lojban word-creation struggle","Lojban word-making difficulty","a|32O|32P","o|f|32L|32M|32N|V|32Q","jbovlaste","s|$x_1=li_1$ is a list of words $x_2=v_1$ in Lojban ($v_3$=lo lojbo), in order $x_3=li_3$, preserved in medium $x_4=li_4$.","s|In a la-description, jbovlaste refers to the online dictionary editing system.","dictionary","a|32V","o|f|32S|32T|32U|V|32W","jbovla","s|$x_1$ is a defined Lojban word, considered as a word as per Lojban's grammar, with meaning/role $x_2$","s|In Lojban, particles such as \"lo\", \"ku\" etc. are considered to be words, whereas they may not be considered so according to other standards (for example, as \"lo\" and \"ku\" cannot appear in isolation, they are arguably closer to clitics than independent words).

The term \"flightless bird\" may be used, but the term is basically synonymous with his word only by circumstance/happenstance, not by logic: it is conceivable that, in another universe, there could exist a bird which is flightless but which does not primarily/characteristically walk; thus, flightless birds form a superclass which contains (modulo some fuzziness) dzucpi, but in reality, the relative complement of these classes is empty.
