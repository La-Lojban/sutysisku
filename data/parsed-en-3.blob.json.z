These birds should essentially be flightless. Many ratites, penguins, and extinct species qualify; additionally, in some contexts, domesticated chickens and ducks might qualify (at least as {ta'e dzucpi}). Walking must be a fundamental characteristic of the bird. The class of such birds does not form a phylogenic tree or taxon; it is just a conceptual organizer/bin to be used for identifying birds with similar, fundamentally important, physical characteristics. The term \"flightless bird\" may be used, but the term is basically synonymous with his word only by circumstance/happenstance, not by logic: it is conceivable that, in another universe, there could exist a bird which is flightless but which does not primarily/characteristically walk; thus, flightless birds form a superclass which contains (modulo some fuzziness) dzucpi, but in reality, the relative complement of these classes is empty.

Rafsi of these forms must be memorized alongside their source gismu, since they are assigned arbitrarily (within some constraints).
